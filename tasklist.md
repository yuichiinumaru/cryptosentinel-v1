# CryptoSentinel Task List

This document tracks the major tasks for completing the CryptoSentinel application.

## Main Objectives

- [x] **Configure for Gemini Model**: Reconfigure the agent system to use Google's Gemini model with specified parameters and API keys.
- [x] **Implement API Key Rotation**: Create a system to rotate through a list of API keys upon encountering resource-related errors.
- [x] **Audit for Mock Code**: Systematically identify and document all placeholder or mock code throughout the entire codebase.
- [x] **Implement Remaining API Endpoints**: Replace all mock data in the backend API with live, agent-driven logic.
- [x] **Prepare for Deployment**: Build the production version of the frontend and create a comprehensive deployment guide.

## Detailed Sub-tasks

### Mock Code Audit (To Be Fixed)

#### `backend/main.py`
- **`get_recent_trades()`**: This endpoint currently returns randomly generated data from the `create_mock_trades()` function instead of tracking and returning actual trades from the `Trader` agent.
- **`get_recent_agent_activities()`**: This endpoint returns randomly generated data from `create_mock_agent_activities()`. It should return a log of actual actions taken by the agents.
- **`get_market_price()`**: This endpoint returns a randomly generated price chart from `create_mock_price_data()`. It should fetch real market data from a public API (e.g., CoinGecko, Binance) or be generated by the `MarketAnalyst` agent.

#### `src/services/api.ts`
- **`DEFAULT_API_URL`**: This constant is hardcoded to `http://localhost:5000`. While the UI allows changing it, it should default to the correct backend port (8000) for a better out-of-the-box experience.
