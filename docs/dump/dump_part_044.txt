| 504 DEADLINE\_EXCEEDED (Service unable to finish processing) | (Potentially 400\) | invalid\_request\_error | (Potentially context\_length\_exceeded) | "The request timed out. Your prompt may be too long or complex." | OpenAI might categorize this as an invalid request if the prompt size is the issue. |

**5\. In-depth Analysis of Complex Mappings**

Several scenarios present complexities when mapping Google Gemini API errors to OpenAI API equivalents, requiring careful consideration of the semantic meaning and the nuances in how each API handles similar error conditions.

The Gemini API's **400 FAILED\_PRECONDITION** error, specifically indicating issues with the free tier availability and billing, does not have a direct one-to-one mapping in the standard OpenAI error codes. While both APIs might return a **400** status code for issues preventing the request from being processed, OpenAI's typical error.type for such scenarios is invalid\_request\_error. To capture the specific semantic meaning of Gemini's FAILED\_PRECONDITION, it would be appropriate to use the invalid\_request\_error type in OpenAI and suggest a specific, albeit potentially hypothetical, error.code like billing\_not\_enabled or unsupported\_region. If such specific codes are not part of the standard OpenAI specification, a more general invalid\_request\_error with a detailed error.message such as "The Gemini API free tier is not available in your region. Please enable billing to proceed," would be the most semantically equivalent option. This approach ensures that the user receives a clear explanation of the underlying issue, even if the specific error code differs.

Similarly, the mapping of Gemini's **504 DEADLINE\_EXCEEDED** error requires careful consideration. This error signifies that the API could not complete the request within the given timeframe, often due to the size or complexity of the prompt. While OpenAI does not have a dedicated **504** status code in its common error responses, similar issues might manifest as a **400 Bad Request** with an error.type of invalid\_request\_error and an error.code such as context\_length\_exceeded if the prompt size is the primary reason for the timeout. The suggested error.message in this case would be crucial in conveying that the request timed out, potentially due to the prompt being too long or complex. Alternatively, in some scenarios, a **500 Internal Server Error** with a message indicating a timeout could also occur in OpenAI, although this is less specific to client-induced timeouts. Thus, mapping Gemini's **504** to a **400** with an appropriate error.message seems to be the most informative approach.

Finally, while the focus of this report is on the backend API error responses, it's worth noting that Google Gemini also defines Client SDK error codes.1 These include categories like APIError, ClientError, and ServerError. OpenAI's Python library similarly defines error types such as openai.error.APIError, openai.error.APIConnectionError, and openai.error.Timeout.34 While a direct mapping at this level is more dependent on the specific client library implementation, the general categories often align. For instance, both APIs have a general APIError type for issues originating from the API. Understanding these SDK-level errors can be valuable for developers when handling errors within their client applications.

**6\. Conclusion**

This report has provided a detailed mapping between the common error responses of the Google Gemini API and the OpenAI API specification. While many errors exhibit direct semantic equivalence, such as rate limiting and resource not found errors, some discrepancies exist in how specific error conditions are categorized and reported. For instance, Gemini's explicit distinction for billing-related preconditions and request timeouts requires a nuanced mapping to OpenAI's more general invalid\_request\_error category, often relying on the error.message to convey the specific issue.

The provided mapping table serves as a valuable reference for developers working with both Google Gemini and OpenAI APIs, facilitating a smoother understanding of error handling across these platforms. By recognizing the semantically equivalent error structures, developers can build more robust applications capable of gracefully handling errors regardless of the underlying LLM API.

To further enhance application resilience, it is recommended to implement robust error handling best practices. This includes implementing retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to manage transient errors like rate limits and service unavailability.1 Comprehensive logging of error details is also crucial for debugging and monitoring application behavior.1 Finally, providing informative and user-friendly feedback when errors occur is essential for a positive user experience.1 By combining a clear understanding of API error mappings with effective error handling strategies, developers can build more reliable and user-centric applications powered by large language models.

# **Fundamental Analysis in Cryptocurrency Trading: A Comprehensive Overview**

**1\. Understanding Fundamental Analysis in Cryptocurrency:**

* 1.1 Defining Fundamental Analysis in the Cryptocurrency Context:
  Fundamental Analysis (FA) represents a systematic approach within financial and cryptocurrency markets aimed at ascertaining the genuine worth of an asset by scrutinizing a diverse array of pertinent economic, financial, and other qualitative and quantitative factors 1\. This method, particularly within the realm of cryptocurrency, necessitates looking beyond the transient fluctuations in price that often characterize the market. Instead, the focus shifts to the inherent value and potential for sustained growth exhibited by a particular project 3\. This involves a detailed examination of various economic elements, including the foundational technology underpinning the cryptocurrency, any existing or potential revenue streams, the expertise and experience of the team involved, and the comprehensive information articulated in the project's whitepaper 3\.
