## **4\. Guide on How MCPs Can Be Used Within the Agency Swarm Multi-Agent Framework**

Integrating MCPs within the Agency Swarm framework involves treating MCP servers as external tools that your agents can utilize to access data and perform specific actions.

### **4.1. Integration Strategy**

The Agency Swarm framework allows for the definition and use of custom tools. MCP servers can be integrated by creating custom tools within Agency Swarm that communicate with the desired MCP server. This communication typically follows a client-server architecture, where the Agency Swarm agent acts as the MCP client, sending requests to the MCP server and receiving responses.

To integrate an MCP server, you would typically:

1. **Identify a relevant MCP server** that provides the desired functionality (e.g., a cryptocurrency price server).
2. **Determine the communication method** supported by the MCP server. Many MCP servers use standard input/output (stdio) or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for communication 7.
3. **Develop a custom tool within Agency Swarm** that knows how to interact with the chosen MCP server. This tool would need to:
   * Establish a connection with the MCP server (if necessary).
   * Format requests according to the MCP protocol specification for the desired action or data.
   * Send the request to the MCP server.
   * Receive and parse the response from the MCP server.
   * Return the relevant information to the Agency Swarm agent in a structured format that it can understand and utilize.

Agency Swarm's BaseTool class can be extended to create these custom tools, with the run method containing the logic for interacting with the MCP server. The input parameters and output format of the tool can be defined using Pydantic, which is well-integrated with Agency Swarm.

### **4.2. When is it Better to Use Tools Instead of MCPs?**

Agency Swarm provides built-in mechanisms for agents to communicate and share information, as well as the ability to create custom tools that directly interact with APIs or perform specific computations. Deciding whether to use an MCP server or a native Agency Swarm tool depends on several factors:

* **Availability of MCP Servers:** If a well-maintained and suitable MCP server already exists for the desired functionality (e.g., fetching real-time cryptocurrency prices from a specific exchange), integrating with it can save significant development time compared to building a custom tool from scratch that interacts directly with the exchange's API. The growing ecosystem of MCP servers offers a wide range of pre-built integrations.
* **Standardization and Interoperability:** MCPs provide a standardized way for different AI systems to interact with external resources 1. By using MCP servers, you benefit from this standardization, which can lead to more robust and interoperable integrations. If you anticipate potentially switching LLM providers or integrating with other MCP-compatible systems in the future, using MCP servers offers greater flexibility 3.
* **Complexity of Integration:** For very specific or highly customized functionalities that are tightly coupled with the Agency Swarm framework or require intricate internal logic, building a native custom tool might be more straightforward. If the interaction with an external service is very simple and doesn't require the full overhead of the MCP protocol, a direct API call within a custom tool might be more efficient.
* **Security Considerations:** When dealing with sensitive operations like managing wallets, you might prefer to build highly controlled custom tools within Agency Swarm where you have direct oversight of the security implementation, rather than relying on a third-party MCP server. However, well-designed MCP servers also incorporate security measures 5.
* **Performance Requirements:** In scenarios where extremely low latency is critical, a direct integration via a custom tool might offer slightly better performance than going through the MCP client-server communication layer. However, MCP is designed to be efficient, and the overhead is often minimal.
* **Tool Discovery and Management:** MCP aims to facilitate tool discovery, allowing agents to potentially find and utilize new capabilities more easily 4. If you envision your agency dynamically adapting and utilizing new tools, leveraging the MCP ecosystem could be advantageous.

In many cases, especially for accessing common data sources and functionalities like cryptocurrency market data, news feeds, and database interactions, utilizing existing MCP servers through custom Agency Swarm tools can be a highly efficient and beneficial approach.

### **4.3. Use Cases Within the Trader Context**

Here are some specific use cases illustrating how MCPs can be used within the context of your cryptocurrency trading agency:

* **Technical Analyst:** The technical analyst agent can use a custom tool that connects to the Nayshins\_mcp-server-ccxt 10. When the agent needs the current price of Bitcoin in USDT on Binance, it would call this tool with the parameters "BTC/USDT" and "Binance". The tool would then communicate with the MCP server, which in turn fetches the data from Binance and returns it to the agent. Similarly, the agent could use the tool to get historical price data for calculating moving averages.
