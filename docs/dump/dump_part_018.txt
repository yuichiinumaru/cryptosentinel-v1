Exemplo: O MarketAnalyst envia uma recomendação de compra ao DeepTraderManager, que valida o risco antes de autorizar o Trader a executar.

Funcionalidades-Chave
Operação em Tempo Real:

Loop Contínuo: O sistema roda 24/7, com tarefas agendadas (ex: análise de mercado a cada 1 minuto) via integração entre agency.run_loop() e AsyncIOScheduler.

Resposta a Eventos: Reage a mudanças bruscas (ex: quedas de preço >5%) com ajustes imediatos de estratégia.

Gestão de Risco Avançada:

Circuit Breakers: Interrompe trades automaticamente se o portfólio sofrer perdas superiores a 10%.

Limites por Operação: Nenhum trade pode arriscar mais de 2% do capital total.

Monitoramento de Blacklist: Bloqueia tokens com histórico de scams ou baixa liquidez.

Aprendizado Contínuo:

Memória de Longo Prazo: Armazena trades passados em bancos vetoriais (ChromaDB) e relacionais (PostgreSQL), permitindo consultas do tipo "Quais estratégias funcionaram em mercados em baixa?".

Feedback Automático: Um agente LearningCoordinator analisa métricas (ROI, win rate) e ajusta instruções dos agentes (ex: priorizar tokens de alta capitalização após uma semana de baixo desempenho).

Contextualização com RAG:

Documentos Estratégicos: Manuais de análise técnica e fundamentalista são indexados hierarquicamente (ex: sumários, detalhes) para recuperação eficiente.
Técnicas Avançadas: HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) para melhorar queries e reranking com modelos como BGE-Reranker para precisão.

Fluxo Operacional
Coleta de Dados:

O MarketAnalyst puxa preços, volumes e notícias em tempo real, enriquecendo a análise com dados históricos do banco de dados.

Geração de Sinais:

Combina indicadores técnicos, sentimentos de mercado (análise de notícias) e insights do RAG para sugerir trades.

Aprovação e Execução:

O DeepTraderManager valida o risco e o alinhamento estratégico antes de liberar a execução pelo Trader.

Pós-Trade:

O PortfolioManager atualiza o portfólio, enquanto o LearningCoordinator registra o resultado para ajustes futuros.

Diferenciais Inovadores
Autonomia Total: Zero regras pré-programadas (ex: "if price > X, venda"); todas as decisões são tomadas pela LLM com base em ferramentas e contexto.

Modularidade Extrema: Novos agentes (ex: ArbitrageHunter) ou ferramentas (ex: integração com Chainlink para dados on-chain) podem ser adicionados sem interromper o sistema.

Transparência Auditável: Todas as decisões são logadas com histórico completo (quem decidiu, dados usados, resultado), permitindo auditoria pós-fato.

Próximos Passos (Roadmap)
Integração com Modelos Preditivos: Fine-tuning de LLMs para prever movimentos de curto prazo com base em padrões históricos.

Deploy em Cloud Distribuída: Escalonamento horizontal para lidar com múltiplas exchanges simultaneamente.

Simulação em Ambiente Sandbox: Teste de estratégias em dados históricos antes de alocar capital real.

Visão Final
O DeepTrader representa um avanço na automação de trading, substituindo sistemas estáticos baseados em regras por uma equipe virtual de agentes autônomos, adaptáveis e especializados. Projetado para operar com capital limitado (ex: US$ 50 inicialmente), seu objetivo é validar a viabilidade de sistemas multiagente governados por LLMs em ambientes financeiros complexos e imprevisíveis.

DexBot is a smart DEX trading bot for crypto traders, supporting Uniswap, Pancakeswap, and blockchains like BSC, ETH, ARB.
There isn't a specific exchange more commonly used for LLM-based bots; they can integrate with various CEXs and DEXs via APIs.
From the arXiv paper, CryptoTrade has agents like market analysts using technical indicators and news interpreters.
Browsing medium.com for "example prompts for LLM in trading bot"
The Medium article didn't list specific example prompts for LLM trading bots.
Prompts for LLMs in trading bots typically include market data, technical indicators, and news, asking for actions like buy, sell, or hold with portfolio proportions.
Several research papers and projects show LLMs in building autonomous trading bots, like CryptoTrade using GPT-4 and GPT-4o.
Trading bots can integrate with exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Binance for CEXs, and Uniswap, Sushiswap for DEXs.
There is a lot here, so I'm summarizing the key points to help with the request.
The arXiv paper mentions a prompt for the trading agent, deciding to buy, sell, or hold crypto based on market conditions and news, with proportions from -1 to 1.
CryptoTrade uses GPT-4 and GPT-4o, showing better performance than traditional trading signals, according to the arXiv paper (arXiv).
I'm thinking about how this info helps the user build or understand these bots better.
Open-source LLMs like Llama, Falcon, or Mistral could be used for crypto trading, but documentation is limited.
Wallets for these bots are usually exchange-provided or self-custody options like MetaMask for DEXs, ensuring secure transactions.
The arXiv paper provides an example prompt, asking the model to decide on buying, selling, or holding crypto based on market conditions and news, with proportions from -1 to 1 (arXiv).
From the search, URLs like Cryptohopper and Freqtrade offer insights into trading bot integrations (Cryptohopper, Freqtrade).
I'm evaluating how these resources can assist in understanding LLM-based trading bot development.

Key Points
Research suggests that building autonomous crypto trading bots using LLMs involves integrating market and news data, with projects like CryptoTrade showing promising results.
It seems likely that GPT-4o performs best among proprietary LLMs, but open-source models like Llama or Falcon could be used locally, though less commonly documented for trading.
The evidence leans toward bots using exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Binance for centralized trading, and Uniswap, Sushiswap for decentralized, with wallets like MetaMask for DEXs.
Prompts for LLMs typically include market data and news, asking for buy, sell, or hold recommendations with portfolio proportions.
Experiences in Building Autonomous Crypto Trading Bots
Building autonomous crypto trading bots that operate on their own using LLMs is an emerging field, with several research efforts and practical guides available. One key example is the CryptoTrade project, detailed in a research paper from June 2024, which uses LLMs to make daily trading decisions for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana by integrating on-chain and off-chain data. This project demonstrates the potential of LLMs in automating trading without fine-tuning, achieving comparable results to traditional strategies.

Best Performing LLM Models
For trading, research suggests that proprietary models like GPT-4o outperform GPT-4, as shown in the CryptoTrade study. However, for open-source models that can run locally, options like Llama, Falcon, and Mistral exist, though their application in crypto trading bots is less documented. Projects like "Trading-Hero-LLM" on Hugging Face offer open-source sentiment analysis models, but complete trading bots using these locally are not as prevalent.

Commonly Used Exchanges and Wallets
These bots can integrate with various exchanges, both centralized (e.g., Coinbase, Kraken, Binance) and decentralized (e.g., Uniswap, Sushiswap), typically via APIs. Wallets depend on the exchange; for centralized exchanges, the exchange's wallet is used, while for DEXs, popular self-custody wallets like MetaMask are common. Integration methods involve connecting through APIs to execute trades based on LLM recommendations.

Typical Instructions or Prompts
The prompts given to LLMs usually include current market data (e.g., price, moving averages, MACD), technical indicators, and news summaries. The LLM is asked to recommend a trading action—buy, sell, or hold—and often to specify a proportion (e.g., -1 to 1, where -1 is sell all, 0 is hold, 1 is buy all), with reasoning provided step by step.

Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Autonomous Crypto Trading Bots Using LLMs
This survey note provides a detailed examination of autonomous crypto trading bots that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing the user's query comprehensively. The analysis is based on recent research, articles, and project documentation available as of March 11, 2025, ensuring relevance and accuracy.

Experiences in Building Autonomous Crypto Trading Bots
The development of autonomous crypto trading bots using LLMs is an active area of research and application, particularly due to the volatile and data-rich nature of cryptocurrency markets. One significant contribution is the "A Reflective LLM-based Agent to Guide Zero-shot Cryptocurrency Trading" paper, published on arXiv in June 2024 (A Reflective LLM-based Agent to Guide Zero-shot Cryptocurrency Trading). This paper introduces CryptoTrade, a framework that integrates on-chain data (e.g., prices, volumes, transactions from CoinMarketCap and Dune Database) and off-chain data (e.g., news from Gnews API, Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, crypto.news) to execute daily trading strategies for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). CryptoTrade employs a multi-agent system with market analyst, news analyst, trading, and reflection agents, using GPT-4 and GPT-4o without fine-tuning, and achieves performance comparable to traditional signals like MACD and Buy and Hold strategies across bull, sideways, and bear markets. For instance, in an ETH bullish period, CryptoTrade exceeded Buy and Hold by 3% (25.47% vs. 22.59% return).

Beyond research, practical guides and community projects also highlight experiences. For example, a HackerNoon article from November 2023, "How LLMs like ChatGPT Can Change the Way We Trade" (How LLMs like ChatGPT Can Change the Way We Trade), discusses how LLMs can revolutionize market analysis, generate trading signals, and automate processes, emphasizing their ability to process large volumes of textual data for sentiment analysis. Additionally, a Reddit post from December 2024 on r/CryptoCurrency, "Here it is - I made an open source AI crypto trading assistant to help me manage my cryptocurrency portfolio using ..." (Here it is - I made an open source AI crypto trading assistant to help me manage my cryptocurrency portfolio using ...), describes a tool using an LLM connected to an exchange for simplified trading actions, showcasing community-driven efforts.

Best Performing LLM Model for Trading, Including Open-Source Local Models
Regarding performance, the CryptoTrade paper provides empirical evidence that GPT-4o outperforms GPT-4, with specific metrics like return and Sharpe Ratio showing better results (e.g., 28.47% return for BTC bull market with GPT-4o vs. 26.35% with GPT-4). However, the user's interest in open-source models that can run locally is less addressed in mainstream research. Open-source LLMs like Llama, Falcon, and Mistral are viable for local deployment, as noted in "The 11 best open-source LLMs for 2025" on the n8n Blog (The 11 best open-source LLMs for 2025), which lists popular models for AI workflows.
