## Executive Summary
The paper introduces the Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF) framework, a novel approach to agentic recommendations. It draws an analogy between traditional collaborative filtering and LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Instead of using a static, single agent or a generic multi-agent pipeline, MACF dynamically instantiates "user agents" and "item agents" based on a target user's query and history. A central "orchestrator agent" manages these ephemeral agents, issuing personalized instructions and coordinating their interaction to generate recommendations. This allows the system to leverage collaborative signals in a structured, adaptive, and explainable manner, outperforming strong agentic baselines in experiments.

## Idea Brainstorming
The core concept of dynamic, data-driven agent instantiation can be adapted from a "recommendation" context to our "trading" context.
- **Trader Profile Agents:** Instead of "similar users," we could instantiate `TraderProfileAgent` instances from the trading histories of previously successful, similar trading profiles stored in our database. An agent could represent a "whale" profile, a "scalper" profile, or a profile that has historically performed well under similar market conditions.
- **Asset Agents:** Instead of "relevant items," we could instantiate an `AssetAgent` for a specific token (e.g., BTC, ETH). This agent would be an expert on that asset, equipped with tools to analyze its on-chain data, order book, and recent news, providing deep, focused analysis.
- **Orchestrator-Led Task Forces:** The `DeepTraderManager` could evolve into an orchestrator. When faced with a complex decision (e.g., "Should we rebalance the portfolio after this market event?"), it could dynamically spawn a temporary "task force" of `TraderProfileAgent`s and `AssetAgent`s to debate the best course of action from multiple, diverse perspectives before making a final decision. This moves the system from a static team to dynamic, ephemeral expert committees.

## Gap Analysis
*Comparing MACF concepts vs. the current CryptoSentinel codebase.*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dynamic Agent Instantiation** | The agent team is static. The `get_crypto_trading_team` factory creates a fixed set of agents with predefined roles for every session. | A new `EphemeralAgentFactory` is needed to spawn and destroy agents on-the-fly based on runtime data (e.g., a trader ID or an asset symbol). |
| **Orchestrator w/ Personalized Instructions** | `DeepTraderManager` coordinates a fixed team. Agent instructions are loaded from static `.md` files. | The orchestrator needs the ability to generate and send targeted, context-specific instructions to the ephemeral agents it creates. This would require a new tool or mechanism for dynamic prompt generation. |
| **Data-Driven Agent Personas** | Agents are role-based (e.g., `MarketAnalyst`, `RiskAnalyst`). They do not represent specific data entities. | Templates and instruction sets for new agent types like `TraderProfileAgent` and `AssetAgent` are required. |
| **Retrieval of "Similar" Entities** | `KhalaMemoryToolkit` provides generic semantic search. `PortfolioToolkit` can access trade history. | Specialized retrieval functions are needed. For example, a `find_similar_trader_profiles()` tool that can query the database for traders with similar risk profiles, asset preferences, or historical performance patterns. |

## Implementation Plan
*A conceptual, step-by-step plan to integrate the MACF concepts into CryptoSentinel.*

- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundation**
    - [ ] Develop an `EphemeralAgentFactory` capable of instantiating an agent from a data profile (e.g., a dictionary of attributes) and a path to a template instruction file.
    - [ ] Create a new `OrchestrationToolkit` for the `DeepTraderManager` containing a `spawn_agent(profile, template)` tool that uses the new factory.
- [ ] **Phase 2: Data-Driven Agents**
    - [ ] Implement a `TraderProfileToolkit` with a `get_similar_traders(current_context)` function that queries the database to find historical trader profiles relevant to the current market situation.
    - [ ] Create standardized instruction templates for a `TraderProfileAgent` and an `AssetAgent`.
- [ ] **Phase 3: Integration**
    - [ ] Refactor the `DeepTraderManager`'s primary decision loop. Instead of delegating to the static team, it should first use the `TraderProfileToolkit` to identify relevant perspectives.
    - [ ] The manager should then use its `OrchestrationToolkit` to spawn a temporary "task force" of agents.
    - [ ] The manager will then moderate the debate between these ephemeral agents, synthesize their findings, and terminate them after a decision is reached.
