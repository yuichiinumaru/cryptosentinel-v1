## Executive Summary
This paper presents a knowledge-level analysis of how autonomous agents can resolve conflicts between operational constraints in a way that aligns with human expectations. It introduces the "Online, Aligned Mitigation of Novel Constraint Conflicts" (OAMNCC) process model, a taxonomy of conflict types (Unsatisfiability, Mutual Exclusivity, Uncertainty), and a set of knowledge requirements. The core idea is that agents need to move beyond static policies and engage in dynamic, metacognitive reasoning, leveraging abstract knowledge about constraints, preferences, and the situation to make aligned decisions in novel scenarios.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **OAMNCC Process Model:** A 5-step process (Recognize, Assess, Evaluate, Propose, Execute) that can serve as the core logic for our `DeepTraderManager` when it encounters conflicting goals (e.g., a profitable trade violates a risk constraint).
- **Taxonomy of Constraint Conflicts:** This provides a structured way to classify problems. For example, a "Temporal Resource Contention" conflict could arise if two trading opportunities occur simultaneously with limited capital.
- **Knowledge & Metaknowledge Requirements:** The seven identified knowledge types (Constraints & Frames, Expressive Preferences, Action Affordances, Dynamic Situation Model, Information Quality, Mitigation Utility, Conflict Structure) provide a blueprint for a more sophisticated knowledge base within `khala-agentmemory`.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conflict Recognition** | `agentspec` enforces single rules. | Lacks the ability to detect conflicts *between* multiple valid rules. Needs to evolve from a rule enforcer to a conflict detector. |
| **Dynamic Reasoning** | `DeepTraderManager` follows a relatively static, pre-defined policy. | Requires a new, dynamic reasoning loop to implement the 5-step OAMNCC process. |
| **Knowledge Models** | `khala-agentmemory` stores instructions and historical data. | Needs new, structured data models to represent the 7 abstract knowledge types from the paper. |
| **Action Reasoning** | Agents execute specific tools from `backend/tools/`. | No mechanism to reason about the abstract *affordances* of tools in novel situations to generate creative solutions. |
| **Metacognition** | No explicit metacognitive capabilities. | A new `ConflictResolutionToolkit` or `MetacognitionAgent` is needed to handle reasoning about conflict types, mitigation utility, etc. |

## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*

- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundation**
  - [ ] Task 1: Design and implement new schemas in `khala-agentmemory` for the 7 knowledge types.
  - [ ] Task 2: Extend `agentspec` to detect and flag conflicts between constraints, forwarding them to the `DeepTraderManager`.
- [ ] **Phase 2: Reasoning Engine**
  - [ ] Task 3: Create a new `ConflictResolutionToolkit` in `backend/tools/` to encapsulate the core OAMNCC logic (Assess, Evaluate, Propose).
  - [ ] Task 4: Integrate the new toolkit into the `DeepTraderManager`, creating the main orchestration loop for conflict resolution.
- [ ] **Phase 3: Knowledge & Actions**
  - [ ] Task 5: Develop a system for defining and querying "Action Affordances" from the existing tool library.
  - [ ] Task 6: Populate the `khala-agentmemory` with initial knowledge for key constraints and preferences related to trading.
- [ ] **Phase 4: Testing & Evaluation**
  - [ ] Task 7: Create a suite of simulated trading scenarios with known constraint conflicts to test the new system.
  - [ ] Task 8: Implement logging and monitoring to track the agent's reasoning process during conflict resolution.
