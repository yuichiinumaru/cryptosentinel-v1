## Executive Summary
The paper introduces "Orion," a visual agent framework that orchestrates a suite of specialized computer vision tools (e.g., object detection, OCR, geometric analysis) to execute complex, multi-step visual workflows. Unlike monolithic models, Orion's agentic, tool-augmented approach provides transparent and auditable reasoning, bridging the gap between neural perception and symbolic execution. It aims to democratize computer vision by making sophisticated capabilities accessible to non-experts.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **Visual Analysis Agent:** Introduce a new agent, `VisualAnalysisAgent`, that specializes in interpreting visual data like cryptocurrency charts, screenshots of news articles, or social media posts. This would add a new dimension to the existing text/numeric-based analysis.
- **Specialized Visual Toolkits:** Equip the new agent with a suite of visual tools, similar to Orion's approach. This could include:
    - `ChartPatternToolkit`: To visually identify classic trading patterns (e.g., Head and Shoulders, Double Bottom) directly from chart images.
    - `OCRToolkit`: To extract text and sentiment from images, such as screenshots of Twitter posts or news headlines.
    - `GeometricAnalysisToolkit`: To draw and interpret trendlines, support, and resistance levels on chart images.
- **Augmented Debate Framework:** The `VisualAnalysisAgent` would work in parallel with the existing `BullResearcher` and `BearResearcher`. The `DebateCoordinator` would then be updated to synthesize the findings from all three agents (bull, bear, and visual) to form a more robust and multi-modal final recommendation.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Agentic Framework | Strong existing framework with `BullResearcher`, `BearResearcher`, and `DebateCoordinator` agents. The architecture is modular and well-suited for adding new agents. | The framework exists, but needs to be extended to incorporate a new `VisualAnalysisAgent` into the debate process. |
| Tool Orchestration | The existing agents already orchestrate a wide variety of non-visual toolkits (`TechnicalAnalysisToolkit`, `QuantitativeAnalysisToolkit`, etc.). | The core orchestration logic is present, but there are no visual tools to orchestrate. |
| Visual Toolkits | The codebase has **zero** visual analysis capabilities. All tools operate on numerical, text, or blockchain data. | **1. `ChartPatternToolkit`:** A new toolkit to perform visual pattern recognition on chart images. <br> **2. `OCRToolkit`:** A new toolkit to extract text from images. <br> **3. `GeometricAnalysisToolkit`:** A new toolkit for visual trendline analysis. |

## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*

- [ ] Task 1: Develop a proof-of-concept `OCRToolkit` to verify the system's ability to process images and extract text.
- [ ] Task 2: Develop a `ChartPatternToolkit` using a pre-trained computer vision model to identify at least three common chart patterns from an image file.
- [ ] Task 3: Create the new `VisualAnalysisAgent` that utilizes these new toolkits.
- [ ] Task 4: Update the `DebateCoordinator` agent to accept and synthesize the analysis from the `VisualAnalysisAgent` alongside the Bull and Bear researchers.
- [ ] Task 5: Add integration tests to verify the end-to-end flow of a visual analysis contributing to a final trade decision.
