## Executive Summary
The paper introduces the Deep Tree of Research (DToR), a hierarchical framework for organizing and managing multiple research agents. A controller agent spawns and manages multiple "branches" of inquiry, each with its own research agent. This allows for a more comprehensive and in-depth analysis than a single agent, as it can explore multiple perspectives and resolve conflicts between them. The paper also introduces a local-first information retrieval strategy, where agents first consult a local knowledge base before turning to the web. This reduces the risk of hallucinations and improves the quality of the research.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **Hierarchical Research:** The DToR framework can be directly applied to the existing "Debate Team" of agents. The `DeepTraderManager` can be adapted to act as the "DToR controller," spawning and managing the `BullResearcher` and `BearResearcher` as separate "branches" of inquiry.
- **Conflict Resolution:** The `DebateCoordinator`'s role can be expanded to synthesize the findings from these branches, resolving conflicts and producing a final, comprehensive report. This would improve the quality and reliability of the team's analysis.
- **Local-First RAG:** The project already uses a `KhalaMemoryToolkit`, which can be extended to serve as a local knowledge base. This would improve the quality of the research and reduce the risk of hallucinations.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Hierarchical Agent Management | The `DeepTraderManager` acts as a team leader, but does not explicitly manage research "branches". | The `DeepTraderManager` needs to be adapted to act as a "DToR controller," with the ability to spawn, manage, and terminate research agents. |
| Multi-Perspective Analysis | The "Debate Team" provides a basic form of multi-perspective analysis. | The DToR framework would provide a more structured and robust way of managing multiple perspectives. |
| Conflict Resolution | The `DebateCoordinator` acts as a judge, but the process is not well-defined. | The `DebateCoordinator`'s role needs to be expanded to include a more formal process for synthesizing findings and resolving conflicts. |
| Local-First RAG | The `KhalaMemoryToolkit` provides a basic form of local memory. | The `KhalaMemoryToolkit` needs to be extended to serve as a more comprehensive local knowledge base, and the agents need to be adapted to use a local-first retrieval strategy. |

## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*

- [ ] **Task 1:** Adapt the `DeepTraderManager` to act as a "DToR controller."
- [ ] **Task 2:** Adapt the `BullResearcher` and `BearResearcher` to act as "research branches" within the DToR framework.
- [ ] **Task 3:** Expand the `DebateCoordinator`'s role to include a more formal process for synthesizing findings and resolving conflicts.
- [ ] **Task 4:** Extend the `KhalaMemoryToolkit` to serve as a comprehensive local knowledge base.
- [ ] **Task 5:** Adapt the agents to use a local-first retrieval strategy.
