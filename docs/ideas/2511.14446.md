## Executive Summary
The paper introduces Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a training-free framework for complex video understanding that mirrors human cognitive processes. Instead of relying on monolithic, end-to-end Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or expensive RL-trained agents, AVI uses a structured, three-phase reasoning process: **Retrieve, Perceive, and Review**. It operates on a pre-built, structured knowledge base (including entity-centric knowledge graphs) and uses an ensemble of open-source models for reasoning and perception. This system-level design allows it to achieve state-of-the-art performance on long-video benchmarks, demonstrating that a well-designed architecture can outperform models that rely on massive scale alone, while also providing superior interpretability and cost-efficiency.

## Idea Brainstorming
The core concepts from the AVI paper can be directly mapped to our CryptoSentinel project to improve reasoning, efficiency, and interpretability.

- **Three-Phase Reasoning (`Retrieve-Perceive-Review`):** This is the most valuable concept for our system. Our current agents operate on a simple ReAct loop, which can be inefficient for complex financial analysis. A structured, multi-phase approach would be more robust.
    - **`Retrieve` Phase:** In our context, this would be the initial data-gathering stage. The agent would use tools like `MarketDataToolkit` to fetch historical prices, `TechnicalAnalysisToolkit` for basic indicators (without deep interpretation), and potentially a news/sentiment toolkit. The goal is to collect a broad set of raw information without forming a conclusion.
    - **`Perceive` Phase:** This is the deep analysis stage. The agent would apply specialized quantitative tools like `QuantitativeAnalysisToolkit` (e.g., calculating Sharpe, Sortino ratios), `FourierToolkit` for signal processing, or `MarketCorrelationToolkit` to the data gathered during retrieval. This is where raw data is processed into analytical insights or "signals."
    - **`Review` Phase:** The agent synthesizes the evidence from the previous phases. It would look at the retrieved data and the perceived signals to form a final, consolidated judgment (e.g., "Bullish," "Bearish," "Neutral"). This phase is analogous to our existing `DebateCoordinator` but would be implemented within a single, more sophisticated reasoning loop before any action is taken.

- **Structured Knowledge Base (Entity-Centric Graph):** The paper builds a graph of entities (people, objects) and their relationships over time. We can adapt this to create a **Financial Knowledge Graph (FKG)**.
    - **Nodes:** Financial entities like Tokens (`ETH`, `BTC`), Protocols (`Uniswap`, `Aave`), and Wallets/Addresses (`0x...`).
    - **Edges:** Relationships like `TRADED_ON`, `GOVERNED_BY`, `HELD_BY`, `INTERACTED_WITH`.
    - This graph would be built and updated periodically as an offline process. A new `GraphToolkit` would allow agents in the `Retrieve` phase to query this structure to understand complex relationships that are not apparent from simple data lookups (e.g., "Find all tokens related to the developers of Protocol X that are held by top-performing wallets"). This would be a significant upgrade over our current text-based `KhalaMemoryToolkit`.

## Gap Analysis
Comparing the AVI framework to the current CryptoSentinel codebase reveals key architectural gaps.

| Feature/Concept | Current State (CryptoSentinel) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structured Reasoning Protocol** | Agents use a basic, single-loop ReAct process via the `agno` framework. The consensus mechanism in `main.py` is a step towards structured reasoning but is an external, ad-hoc process rather than an intrinsic part of the agent's thinking. | A formal, multi-phase state machine (`Retrieve` -> `Perceive` -> `Review`) managed by a coordinator agent or within the core agent logic itself. This would require phase-specific prompts and dynamically constrained tool access. |
| **Structured Knowledge Base** | `KhalaMemoryToolkit` provides long-term symbolic memory using a vector/document database (SurrealDB). It is effective for semantic search but lacks a structured, relational graph model for entities. | An offline process to build a Financial Knowledge Graph and a new `GraphToolkit` to enable agents to perform relational queries. This would augment or partially replace the role of the current memory system. |
| **Phase-Constrained Tool Access** | All toolkits (`DexToolkit`, `MarketDataToolkit`, etc.) are loaded statically and are theoretically available to the agent at all times. There is no architectural constraint based on the reasoning stage. | A mechanism to classify tools into categories (e.g., `RETRIEVE_TOOLS`, `PERCEIVE_TOOLS`) and a coordinator that only exposes the relevant toolset to the agent based on its current phase (`Retrieve`, `Perceive`). |
| **Iterative Self-Correction** | The system has a `DebateCoordinator` for adversarial review between agents and a `LearningCoordinator` for post-trade analysis. These are macro-level review mechanisms. | An explicit `Review` phase *within* a single agent's reasoning cycle, enabling it to reflect on gathered evidence and decide whether to refine its analysis (re-enter the `Perceive` phase) or finalize its conclusion. |

## Implementation Plan
This is a high-level proposal for integrating the AVI concepts into CryptoSentinel.

- [ ] **Task 1: Implement a Three-Phase `CognitiveCoordinator` Agent.**
    - Define a new agent in `backend/agents/` responsible for managing the `Retrieve`, `Perceive`, and `Review` states.
    - This agent would contain the logic to transition between phases (e.g., when an agent in the `Retrieve` phase signals it has enough data, the coordinator switches to `Perceive`).
    - It would use phase-specific system prompts to guide the underlying LLM's focus.

- [ ] **Task 2: Refactor Toolkits for Phased Access.**
    - Introduce a metadata attribute to the base `Toolkit` class (in `agno` or a local extension) to tag each toolkit with its appropriate phase (e.g., `phase='retrieve'` or `phase='perceive'`).
    - The `CognitiveCoordinator` would read this metadata and dynamically construct the list of available tools to pass to the agent at each step.

- [ ] **Task 3: Develop a Prototype Financial Knowledge Graph (FKG).**
    - Create a new script in `scripts/` to fetch data from sources like CoinGecko, DeFiLlama, and Etherscan to build a simple graph of tokens, protocols, and their relationships.
    - Store the graph in a suitable format (e.g., GML, GraphML, or a database).
    - Create a new `GraphToolkit` in `backend/tools/` with a tool to query this graph. This tool would be made available during the `Retrieve` phase.

- [ ] **Task 4: Integrate the `Review` Phase Logic.**
    - Implement the logic within the `CognitiveCoordinator` for the `Review` phase.
    - In this phase, the agent receives a summary of all evidence collected. Its only "tools" would be to either `finalize_answer` or `request_more_analysis`, which would transition the state back to `Perceive`.
