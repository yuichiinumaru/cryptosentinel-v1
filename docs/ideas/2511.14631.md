## Executive Summary
The paper demonstrates that integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) into multi-agent systems significantly enhances autonomous scientific discovery. By using a VLM-as-a-judge to evaluate plots against domain-specific rubrics, the system enables agents to perform real-time self-correction and steer exploratory data analysis. Case studies in cosmology and astrochemistry show the system can recover from errors and adapt to new datasets without human intervention. On a 10-task benchmark, VLM-augmented systems achieved a pass@1 score of 0.7-0.8, a substantial improvement over code-only (0.2-0.3) and code-and-text (0.4-0.5) baselines, while also providing auditable reasoning traces that improve interpretability.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **VLM as a Judge:** We can introduce a `PlotJudge` agent that uses a VLM to validate the visual outputs of other agents, such as charts and graphs, against a set of dynamically generated, domain-specific criteria.
- **Self-Correction Loop:** The paper's self-correction workflow (`Plot Judge` -> `Plot Debugger` -> `Engineer`) is a powerful mechanism for improving agent reliability. We could implement a similar loop to catch and fix errors in our system's outputs.
- **VLM-guided Exploration:** The "discovery mode," where the VLM identifies scientifically interesting or anomalous features in plots and triggers further exploratory analysis, is a key innovation. This would allow our system to adapt its research trajectory based on intermediate findings.
- **Structured Outputs (Pydantic):** The paper's use of Pydantic schemas for structured agent outputs ensures deterministic routing and robust orchestration. We should adopt this more rigorously to improve the reliability of our agent-to-agent communication.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Agentic Plot Generation | The system has agents that can generate code, which may include plotting, but lacks a specialized agent for visual analysis. | A dedicated `Plotting` toolkit or `PlottingAgent` would be beneficial. |
| VLM Integration | The system is primarily text-based and has no VLM integration for visual feedback. | A new `VisionToolkit` is needed to integrate with a VLM (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro) to analyze images. |
| Self-Correction Workflow | Agents can retry on errors, but there is no structured self-correction loop based on qualitative visual feedback. | New agents like `PlotJudge` and `PlotDebugger`, along with the orchestration logic to manage the feedback loop. |
| Exploratory Data Analysis | The system follows a predefined plan and does not dynamically adapt based on intermediate visual results. | An `ExperimentProposer` agent and logic to trigger and manage exploratory workflows based on VLM feedback. |
| Structured Pydantic Outputs | Pydantic is used in parts of the codebase, but not consistently for all agent outputs. | Stricter enforcement of Pydantic schemas for all agent communication to improve reliability and enable deterministic routing. |

## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*

- [ ] Task 1: Develop a new `VisionToolkit` that integrates with a VLM API to analyze images and provide structured feedback.
- [ ] Task 2: Create a `PlotJudge` agent that uses the `VisionToolkit` to evaluate plots against a dynamically generated rubric.
- [ ] Task 3: Create a `PlotDebugger` agent that takes feedback from the `PlotJudge` and suggests code modifications.
- [ ] Task 4: Integrate the `PlotJudge` and `PlotDebugger` agents into a self-correction workflow within the main agent orchestration logic.
- [ ] Task 5: Develop an `ExperimentProposer` agent that can design new experiments based on VLM feedback in a "discovery mode."
- [ ] Task 6: Implement the necessary orchestration to switch between "correction" and "discovery" modes.
- [ ] Task 7: Refactor existing agent communication to use Pydantic schemas more consistently for structured I/O.
- [ ] Task 8: Create a benchmark similar to the one in the paper to test the new capabilities.
