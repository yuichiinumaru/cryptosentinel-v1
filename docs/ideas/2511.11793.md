## Executive Summary
The MiroThinker paper introduces a high-performance, open-source research agent that achieves state-of-the-art results by focusing on three scaling dimensions: model size, context length, and a novel concept called "interactive scaling." Interactive scaling is the systematic training of the model to handle deeper and more frequent interactions with its environment, using reinforcement learning to refine its performance. The paper also highlights a "recency-based context retention" strategy to manage long conversations efficiently, allowing for up to 600 tool calls within a 256K context window.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **Recency-Based Context Retention:** This is a highly valuable and pragmatic concept for our system. As agent teams engage in complex, multi-turn financial analysis, the conversation history can grow excessively. Implementing a similar retention strategy would reduce token consumption, improve inference speed, and focus the agent's attention on the most relevant recent information.
- **Interactive Scaling via RL:** While a full RL pipeline is a significant undertaking, the core idea of training agents to improve through environmental feedback is a powerful long-term goal. We could start by collecting telemetry on tool use successes and failures to build a dataset for future preference tuning.
- **Intelligent Scraping Tool:** The paper describes a web scraping tool that uses a lightweight LLM to extract task-relevant information. This is a significant improvement over naive scraping and could be adapted for financial documents, news articles, or social media sentiment analysis, providing agents with condensed, relevant data instead of raw HTML.
- **MiroFlow Multi-Agent Paradigm for Data Synthesis:** Although our system uses a multi-agent team at runtime, the paper's use of a multi-agent system to *synthesize* high-quality training data is an interesting concept for future model improvements.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agent Paradigm** | Runtime multi-agent team (`DeepTraderManager`, `MarketAnalyst`, etc.). | The paper uses a multi-agent system for data synthesis, not runtime execution. The runtime model is a single ReAct agent. Our approach is fundamentally different. |
| **Interactive Scaling** | None. Agents are instantiated with fixed instructions and do not learn from interactions. | A complete reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline, including environment setup, reward design, and a training loop like GRPO, is absent. |
| **Context Management** | None. The full conversation history is likely passed to the model in each turn, leading to potential context overflow and inefficiency. | An explicit context management strategy like "Recency-Based Context Retention" needs to be implemented. |
| **Tooling** | Highly specialized for finance (DEX, Portfolio, Market Data). | Lacks the general-purpose, sandboxed execution environment (`run_command`, `run_python_code`) and the "intelligent scraping" tool described in the paper. |

## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*

- [ ] **Short-Term (High Value):**
    - [ ] Implement a `RecencyBasedHistoryManager` that trims the conversation history passed to the agent team, retaining all thoughts/actions but only the last K tool observations.
    - [ ] Integrate this manager into the `Team` class in `backend/agents/__init__.py`.
- [ ] **Medium-Term (Strategic Enhancement):**
    - [ ] Develop a new `IntelligentScraperToolkit` that takes a URL and a query, uses a smaller LLM (e.g., a local GGUF model) to extract relevant information, and returns a condensed summary.
    - [ ] Add the new toolkit to the `MarketAnalyst` agent.
- [ ] **Long-Term (Research & Development):**
    - [ ] Begin logging agent trajectories (state, action, observation, outcome) to a structured database to build a dataset for future training.
    - [ ] Research and prototype a simplified RL pipeline based on the paper's GRPO approach to fine-tune agent performance on specific financial tasks.
