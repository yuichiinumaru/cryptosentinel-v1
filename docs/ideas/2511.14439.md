## Executive Summary
The paper introduces MedBench v4, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating medical AI systems, including LLMs, multimodal models, and intelligent agents. A key finding is that while base LLMs have significant gaps in safety and reasoning, orchestrating them within an agentic framework dramatically improves both end-to-end performance and safety. This suggests that the path to building robust and reliable AI systems like CryptoSentinel lies not just in improving the core models, but in developing sophisticated, governance-aware agentic architectures and rigorous evaluation benchmarks.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **Concept 1: Agent Benchmarking Framework:** The most significant takeaway is the value of a dedicated benchmarking suite. We could create a "CryptoBench" to systematically evaluate our trading agents' performance. This would involve creating a standardized set of tasks (e.g., analyzing specific market events, executing trades under certain risk conditions) and scoring agents based on profitability, risk management, and adherence to safety rules (`AgentSpec`).
- **Concept 2: Advanced Agentic Orchestration:** The paper emphasizes "governance-aware agentic orchestration." Our current "consensus" mechanism in `main.py` is a simple, hardcoded version of this. We could evolve this into a more powerful, flexible `OrchestratorAgent` or `ConsensusToolkit` that can manage different agent collaboration patterns (e.g., debates, multi-agent voting) and enforce safety protocols during complex tasks, rather than having this logic in the API layer.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Robust Benchmarking Framework** | None. Agent performance is not systematically evaluated. | A complete evaluation framework is needed, including a library of standardized tasks, a scoring system, and a `BenchmarkRunner` to execute the tests. |
| **Agentic Orchestration** | A basic, hardcoded consensus mechanism exists in the `/chat` endpoint of `main.py`. The `DeepTraderManager` acts as a simple leader. | A dedicated, flexible orchestration layer or agent is missing. The current implementation is rigid and mixed with API logic. |
| **Safety & Governance Evaluation** | Safety is implemented via the `RiskAnalyst` agent and `AgentSpec` rules. | There is no framework to *quantify* safety or systematically benchmark agent behavior against safety rules to identify failure modes. |
| **Multimodal Reasoning** | The system is entirely text-based. | Not applicable to the current architecture, but a major gap for future development (e.g., analyzing charts). |

## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*

- [ ] **Phase 1: Foundational Benchmarking**
  - [ ] Task 1: Design and implement a `BenchmarkTask` Pydantic schema to define a standard structure for an evaluation task.
  - [ ] Task 2: Create an initial set of 5-10 benchmark tasks focused on the `MarketAnalyst` agent (e.g., summarizing news, predicting price movement from an article).
  - [ ] Task 3: Develop a `BenchmarkRunner.py` script that can load these tasks, run them against the target agent, and store the results.
- [ ] **Phase 2: Improving Orchestration**
  - [ ] Task 4: Refactor the hardcoded "consensus" logic from `backend/main.py` into a new, reusable `ConsensusToolkit`.
  - [ ] Task 5: Update `main.py` to use the new toolkit, simplifying the endpoint logic.
- [ ] **Phase 3: Safety Benchmarking**
  - [ ] Task 6: Create a set of benchmark tasks designed to test the `Trader` agent's adherence to `AgentSpec` rules (e.g., attempting a large trade that should be blocked).
  - [ ] Task 7: Extend the `BenchmarkRunner` to score tasks based on safety and rule compliance, not just output correctness.
