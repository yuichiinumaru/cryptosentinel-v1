## Executive Summary
The paper proposes a hybrid multi-agent system (MAS) architecture that leverages a high-level, LLM-based "Planner Agent" to orchestrate a team of specialized, more efficient agents (e.g., rule-based or SLMs) for a prescriptive maintenance use case. This layered approach combines the strategic reasoning and planning capabilities of LLMs with the domain-specific efficiency of smaller agents. For CryptoSentinel, adopting this model would mean evolving from a collaborative team of agents to a hierarchical structure led by a central orchestrator. This would enhance system robustness, clarify agent roles, and create more transparent, auditable trading workflows.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **Concept 1: Hierarchical Agent Orchestration.** Introduce a new `OrchestratorAgent` to serve as the "brain" of the agent team. This agent would take high-level goals from the user (e.g., "Identify and execute a high-alpha trade for ETH"), decompose them into a sequence of tasks, and delegate these tasks to the appropriate specialist agents (`MarketAnalyst`, `RiskAnalyst`, `Trader`). This shifts the system from a peer-to-peer agent collaboration to a more directed, hierarchical command structure.
- **Concept 2: Formalized Operational Layers.** The paper's layered model (perception, analytics, optimization) can be directly mapped to the crypto trading domain to better define agent responsibilities:
    - **Perception Layer:** The `MarketAnalyst` agent would be responsible for gathering all raw market data (e.g., price feeds, order books, news sentiment) using the `MarketDataToolkit`.
    - **Analytics Layer:** A new or enhanced agent (e.g., `SignalGenerator`) would process the raw data from the Perception Layer to identify potential trading opportunities, generating actionable signals.
    - **Optimization & Execution Layer:** The `Trader` agent would receive a signal, consult the `RiskAnalyst` to determine optimal position sizing and risk parameters (stop-loss, take-profit), and execute the final trade using the `DexToolkit`.
- **Concept 3: Enhanced Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) for Auditing.** The `OrchestratorAgent` would generate a clear, human-readable execution plan for each high-level goal. This plan would be presented in the frontend, requiring explicit user approval before the `Trader` agent is permitted to execute any transactions, thereby improving safety and transparency.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hybrid Agentic Model (Planner + Specialists)** | A collaborative multi-agent system exists, where agents are instantiated as peers by a factory (`backend/agents/__init__.py`). | A dedicated, high-level `OrchestratorAgent` is needed to manage the workflow hierarchically and provide centralized strategic planning. |
| **Layered Operational Model** | The system has architectural layers (API, agents, tools), but agent roles are not formally defined within an operational flow (e.g., perception -> analytics -> execution). | The responsibilities of existing agents need to be formally refactored to fit into the distinct Perception, Analytics, and Execution layers, improving modularity and clarity. |
| **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) for Auditing** | The frontend serves as a dashboard to view agent activities and results, providing a basic HITL interface. | The system lacks a formal pre-execution approval step. The `OrchestratorAgent` should generate an explicit plan that must be approved by a human user via the UI before any on-chain transaction is executed. |

## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*

- [ ] **Agent:** Define the new `OrchestratorAgent` in the `backend/agents/` directory, equipping it with planning and task-delegation capabilities.
- [ ] **Architecture:** Modify the `AgentFactory` in `backend/agents/__init__.py` to instantiate the `OrchestratorAgent` as the primary entry point, which in turn coordinates the specialist agents.
- [ ] **Refactor:** Refine the roles of the `MarketAnalyst`, `Trader`, and `RiskAnalyst` agents to align with the formal Perception, Analytics, and Execution layers.
- [ ] **API:** Develop new API endpoints in `backend/main.py` to expose the execution plans generated by the `OrchestratorAgent`.
- [ ] **Frontend:** Update the frontend UI (`src/`) to fetch, display, and allow user approval/rejection of the execution plans before they are dispatched for execution.
