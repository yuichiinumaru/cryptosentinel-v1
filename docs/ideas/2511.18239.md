## Executive Summary
This paper introduces a "Priority Score" to identify high-risk neighborhoods for childhood lead exposure. The score integrates the proportion of untested children, the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels, and public health coverage patterns. The study then evaluates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) with agentic reasoning to allocate public health resources based on this score. The results show that LLMs have significant limitations, often misallocating resources and overlooking the most vulnerable areas.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **Concept 1: Priority Score for Resource Allocation:** The concept of a weighted "Priority Score" could be adapted for our system to prioritize different tasks or data sources. For example, we could create a scoring system to rank the urgency of different alerts or the reliability of different data feeds.
- **Concept 2: LLM Evaluation Framework:** The paper's methodology for evaluating LLMs on a specific, real-world task (resource allocation) provides a good model for how we could design our own evaluations for the agents in our system. We could create standardized "scenarios" and metrics to benchmark the performance of our agents on their designated tasks.
- **Concept 3: Health Coverage as a Proxy for Vulnerability:** The idea of using an "intermediate indicator" like health coverage type as a proxy for a more complex, harder-to-measure variable (like socioeconomic vulnerability) is a powerful one. We could explore similar proxy variables in our own domain to improve our models' performance when direct data is scarce.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Priority Scoring System | No explicit priority scoring system is in place. Agents process information as it comes in. | A module for calculating and assigning priority scores to incoming data or tasks could be developed. |
| LLM/Agent Evaluation Framework | Testing is primarily done on a unit-test level. No standardized framework for evaluating agent performance on complex, multi-factorial tasks. | A dedicated evaluation suite with predefined scenarios and performance metrics to benchmark agent decision-making. |
| Use of Proxy Variables | The system primarily relies on direct data feeds and does not systematically use proxy variables to infer missing information. | Research and integration of relevant proxy variables to enhance the system's understanding of the environment, especially under conditions of data scarcity. |

## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*

- [ ] Task 1: Design and implement a `PriorityScorer` module that can be configured with different weighted metrics.
- [ ] Task 2: Develop a set of evaluation scenarios for our key agents (e.g., `BullResearcher`, `BearResearcher`) based on historical data.
- [ ] Task 3: Create a performance benchmarking script that runs the agents through the evaluation scenarios and reports on their accuracy and efficiency.
- [ ] Task 4: Research and document potential proxy variables that could be used to enhance our system's data.
