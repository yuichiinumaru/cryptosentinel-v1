## Executive Summary
The paper introduces "Mixture of Reasoning" (MoR), a framework designed to enhance the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by moving away from manually crafted, task-specific prompts. The core idea is to fine-tune models on a diverse set of reasoning strategies, enabling them to adapt their problem-solving approach autonomously.

The MoR framework consists of two main phases:
1.  **Thought Generation:** A powerful model like GPT-4o is used to generate a large number of abstract "reasoning chain templates" that capture different problem-solving patterns (e.g., step-by-step deduction, analogical reasoning).
2.  **SFT Dataset Construction:** These templates are then paired with questions from benchmark datasets to create a high-quality Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) dataset.

By training a smaller model on this dataset, the model internalizes these adaptive reasoning capabilities, allowing it to perform complex reasoning tasks effectively without requiring specific, engineered prompts. This approach reduces the dependency on manual prompt engineering and improves the model's generalizability and performance.

## Idea Brainstorming
The concepts in this paper are highly relevant to the `CryptoSentinel` project, particularly with its ongoing ARTEMIS integration, which aims to create a more dynamic and adaptive agent architecture.

- **Dynamic Prompt Generation:** The central idea of assembling prompts at runtime is a perfect fit. Instead of static `instructions.md` files, we can create a `PromptBuilder` that combines a base agent persona with one or more "reasoning chain templates." This would allow an agent like the `MarketAnalyst` to use a "technical_analysis" template for one query and a "fundamental_analysis" template for another, making it far more versatile.
- **Reasoning Template Library:** We can establish a centralized library of reasoning strategies in a new `backend/prompts/templates/` directory. This library could include templates for Chain-of-Thought (`cot.md`), Tree-of-Thought (`tot.md`), self-critique (`self_critique.md`), and domain-specific strategies like "smart contract security analysis." This modular approach aligns with the project's goal of creating a more maintainable and scalable cognitive architecture.
- **Simulated Agent Specialization:** While a full Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) pipeline is a long-term goal, we can simulate the paper's concept of specialization in the short term. By equipping different agents with different *sets* of reasoning templates during instantiation, we can create specialized behaviors. For example, a `RiskAnalyst` might be given templates focused on counterfactual reasoning and risk assessment, while a `Trader` agent gets templates for execution logic and order management.

## Gap Analysis
A comparison of the MoR concepts against the current state of the `CryptoSentinel` codebase reveals the following gaps:

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prompting Mechanism** | Static and monolithic. Each agent's behavior is defined by a single, hardcoded `instructions.md` file. | A dynamic `PromptBuilder` class is needed to assemble prompts from multiple components (e.g., base persona + reasoning templates) at runtime. |
| **Reasoning Strategies** | Implicit and hardcoded within the `instructions.md` files. They are not reusable or modular. | A dedicated, version-controlled library of reusable reasoning templates (e.g., in `backend/prompts/templates/`) is required. |
| **Agent Instantiation** | The `create_agent` function in `backend/factory.py` is designed to load only a single instruction file. The `get_crypto_trading_team` function uses this static factory. | The `create_agent` function must be refactored to accept a list of template names. The `get_crypto_trading_team` function must be updated to select and provide these templates based on the agent's role or the task's context. |
| **SFT (Fine-Tuning)** | No fine-tuning capabilities exist. The system relies entirely on pre-trained models provided by an API. | The entire SFT pipeline, including dataset creation, training job management, and model deployment, is absent. This is a significant long-term endeavor and is not part of the initial implementation plan. |

## Implementation Plan
To integrate the core ideas of the MoR paper, the following step-by-step plan will be executed:

- [ ] **Task 1: Create Reasoning Template Library:**
    - Create a new directory: `backend/prompts/templates/`.
    - Populate this directory with initial reasoning templates, such as `chain_of_thought.md` and `risk_assessment.md`, to serve as a proof of concept.
- [ ] **Task 2: Implement PromptBuilder:**
    - Create a new file, `backend/prompts/builder.py`.
    - Implement a `PromptBuilder` class within this file. This class will be responsible for loading a base persona and one or more reasoning templates and combining them into a single, coherent string.
- [ ] **Task 3: Refactor Agent Factory:**
    - Modify the `create_agent` function in `backend/factory.py`.
    - The function will be updated to accept a list of template names instead of a static `instructions_path`. It will use the new `PromptBuilder` to generate the agent's final instructions.
- [ ] **Task 4: Update Team Assembly:**
    - Refactor the `get_crypto_trading_team` function in `backend/agents/__init__.py`.
    - Update the agent creation calls (e.g., for `MarketAnalyst`, `Trader`) to pass a list of appropriate reasoning template names to the `create_agent` function.
- [ ] **Task 5: Add Unit Tests:**
    - Create a new test file, `tests/test_prompt_builder.py`.
    - Add a unit test to verify that the `PromptBuilder` correctly assembles prompts from various combinations of templates.
