## Executive Summary
The paper introduces "Mixture of Reasoning" (MoR), a framework to improve LLM reasoning by fine-tuning them on a dataset of diverse reasoning templates. This allows the model to learn and adapt its reasoning strategies without explicit, task-specific prompts, leading to more robust and generalizable performance.

## Idea Brainstorming
- **Enhanced Agent Reasoning:** The MoR framework can be used to enhance the reasoning capabilities of the `BullResearcher` and `BearResearcher` agents. By training them on a curated dataset of financial analysis reasoning chains, we can make them more adaptive to different market conditions and trading scenarios.
- **Dynamic Strategy Selection:** Instead of relying on a fixed set of prompts, the agents could learn to select the most appropriate reasoning strategy for a given situation, potentially leading to better trading decisions.
- **Reduced Prompt Engineering:** By embedding reasoning strategies into the models themselves, we can reduce the need for complex and brittle prompt engineering.

## Gap Analysis

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Diverse Reasoning Strategies | Agents have fixed, prompt-based reasoning. | A dataset of financial reasoning chains for fine-tuning. |
| Adaptive Reasoning | Agents follow a fixed debate structure. | A mechanism for agents to dynamically select reasoning strategies. |
| Fine-tuning Pipeline | No fine-tuning pipeline exists. | A complete pipeline for SFT of the agents. |

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] Task 1: Create a dataset of financial analysis reasoning chains.
- [ ] Task 2: Develop a fine-tuning pipeline for the `BullResearcher` and `BearResearcher` agents.
- [ ] Task 3: Fine-tune the agents using the MoR framework.
- [ ] Task 4: Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned agents against the baseline.
- [ ] Task 5: Integrate the fine-tuned agents into the trading system.
