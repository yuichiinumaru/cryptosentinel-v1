# Paper 1707.02275v1: Automated Code Documentation and Generation

## 1. Summary

The research paper "A parallel corpus of Python functions and documentation strings for automated code documentation and code generation" introduces a dataset and methodology for training models to translate between Python code and natural language docstrings. This enables two key functionalities:

*   **Automated Code Generation**: Generating Python code from a natural language description.
*   **Automated Code Documentation**: Generating a docstring for a given Python function.

## 2. Integration Points

The concepts from this paper can be integrated into the CryptoSentinel project to enhance the capabilities of the `Dev` and `StrategyAgent` agents.

### 2.1. `Dev` Agent

The `Dev` agent is responsible for developing and maintaining the tools and infrastructure of the system. The following tools will be added to its `dev_toolkit`:

*   **`CodeGenerator`**: This tool will take a natural language description of a function and generate the corresponding Python code, including error handling and logging.
*   **`DocstringGenerator`**: This tool will take a Python function and generate a comprehensive docstring, including a summary, arguments, and return values.

### 2.2. `StrategyAgent`

The `StrategyAgent` is responsible for developing, testing, and optimizing trading strategies. The following tool will be added to its `strategy_toolkit`:

*   **`StrategyGenerator`**: This tool will take a natural language description of a trading strategy and generate the corresponding Python code, including entry and exit conditions, stop-loss, and take-profit levels.

## 3. Gap Analysis

To implement these new features, the following components need to be built:

*   **`CodeGenerator` tool**: A new tool that takes a natural language description and generates a Python function.
*   **`DocstringGenerator` tool**: A new tool that takes a Python function and generates a docstring.
*   **`StrategyGenerator` tool**: A new tool that takes a natural language description of a trading strategy and generates the corresponding Python code.
*   **`Backtesting` integration**: The `StrategyGenerator` tool will need to be integrated with the `BacktestingTool` to allow for the immediate testing of newly generated strategies.
