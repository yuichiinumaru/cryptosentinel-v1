# Integration Plan for Paper 2506.07411: Intelligent Fault Self-Healing Mechanism (IFSHM)

This document outlines the plan to integrate the Intelligent Fault Self-Healing Mechanism (IFSHM) from a new research paper into the CryptoSentinel project.

## 1. Summary of the Paper

The paper proposes a hybrid architecture that combines a Large Language Model (LLM) for semantic fault interpretation with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for optimizing recovery strategies. The goal is to create a self-healing system that can understand and adapt to a wide range of faults in cloud-based AI systems.

## 2. Integration Points

Based on the paper and the current codebase, the following integration points have been identified:

*   **New Agent:** A `SelfHealingAgent` will be created to orchestrate the fault detection and recovery process.
*   **New Toolkits:**
    *   `FaultDiagnosisToolkit`: This will include tools to interact with monitoring and logging systems. The key tool will be `interpret_fault_semantics`, which will use an LLM to analyze system data.
    *   `SystemRecoveryToolkit`: This will provide the agent with a set of actions to remediate faults, such as `restart_service`, `scale_deployment`, etc.
*   **Memory Integration:** The existing `khala-agentmemory` package will be used to implement the "Memory-guided meta-control" aspect of the IFSHM.

## 3. Gap Analysis

A detailed gap analysis has been performed, and the following components need to be built:

*   **Fault Diagnosis and Recovery Toolkits:** These new toolkits need to be created.
*   **DRL-based SelfHealingAgent:** A new agent with a DRL implementation needs to be developed.
*   **Memory Adaptation:** The `khala-agentmemory` needs to be adapted to support prioritized experience replay and dynamic prompt updates for the LLM.

## 4. Implementation Plan

The implementation will be carried out in the following phases:

1.  **Phase 1: Toolkit Development:** Create the `FaultDiagnosisToolkit` and `SystemRecoveryToolkit` with the necessary tools.
2.  **Phase 2: Agent and DRL Implementation:** Develop the `SelfHealingAgent` and integrate the DRL logic.
3.  **Phase 3: Memory Integration:** Adapt the `khala-agentmemory` to support the memory-guided meta-control.
4.  **Phase 4: Testing and Deployment:** Thoroughly test the new self-healing system and deploy it to the production environment.
