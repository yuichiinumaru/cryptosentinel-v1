# Paper 2403.08488: CAM Dataset Integration

## 1. Paper Summary
The research paper "CAM: A Collection of Snapshots of GitHub Java Repositories Together with Metrics" introduces a valuable dataset of Java code metrics from over 500,000 classes across thousands of GitHub repositories. The dataset includes metrics like Cyclomatic Complexity, Halstead Effort, LCOM5, and others, which can serve as proxies for code quality, development activity, and project health.

## 2. Gap Analysis
CryptoSentinel's current metric set is exclusively focused on financial and market data (e.g., Sharpe Ratio, RSI, Moving Averages). There are no metrics related to the underlying code quality or development health of the cryptocurrency projects it trades. The CAM dataset provides an opportunity to fill this gap, introducing a new dimension of analysis that is orthogonal to existing strategies.

## 3. Integration Plan

### 3.1. Data Pipeline
1.  **Download:** A script will be created to download the latest CAM dataset from its S3 bucket.
2.  **Process:** The dataset will be processed to extract the relevant metrics for each repository.
3.  **Map:** A mapping will be created between the GitHub repositories in the CAM dataset and their corresponding cryptocurrency tickers. This is a critical and potentially challenging step that may require a combination of automated heuristics and manual verification.
4.  **Store:** The processed and mapped data will be stored in the `khala-agentmemory` database, likely in a new collection dedicated to code-level metrics.

### 3.2. New Toolkit
A new toolkit, `CodeMetricsToolkit`, will be developed to provide agents with an interface to query the CAM dataset. This toolkit will include functions to:
*   `get_metrics_for_ticker(ticker: str)`: Fetches all available code metrics for a given cryptocurrency ticker.
*   `get_top_n_by_metric(metric: str, n: int)`: Returns the top `n` projects ranked by a specific code metric.

### 3.3. Agent Integration
The `CodeMetricsToolkit` will be integrated into the following agents:
*   **`MarketAnalyst`:** This agent will use the code metrics as a new source of alpha. For example, it could favor projects with high code quality and consistent development activity.
*   **`RiskAnalyst`:** This agent will use the code metrics to identify potential risks. For example, a decline in code quality or a sudden drop in development activity could be a red flag.
*   **`Trader`:** The `Trader` agent will incorporate the signals from the `MarketAnalyst` and `RiskAnalyst` into its trading decisions.

## 4. Potential Challenges
*   **Ticker Mapping:** As mentioned, accurately mapping GitHub repositories to cryptocurrency tickers will be a significant challenge.
*   **Data Staleness:** The CAM dataset is updated annually, so the data may not always be fresh. This will need to be taken into account when developing trading strategies.
*   **Metric Interpretation:** The relationship between code metrics and market performance is not well-established. It will require careful research and backtesting to determine how to best use this new data.
