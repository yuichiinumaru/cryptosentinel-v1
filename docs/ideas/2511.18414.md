## Executive Summary
The paper introduces "AutoMAS," a generic multi-agent system (MAS) designed for algorithm self-adaptation in dynamic wireless networks. The core idea is that a single, static algorithm is insufficient for environments that change over time. AutoMAS addresses this by using a `Supervisor` agent that perceives the current environment, selects a team of specialized `Executor` agents from a pool, and orchestrates their collaboration through a dynamic workflow. This allows the system to autonomously choose and execute the most suitable algorithm for the current context, demonstrating superior performance over fixed-algorithm approaches in a case study on channel estimation.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **Supervisor-Executor Model:** This is the most valuable concept. We can adapt this model to replace our current, more rigid agent coordination mechanisms. The `DeepTraderManager` could be evolved into a `Supervisor` that doesn't just manage a debate, but actively selects agents and strategies based on market conditions.
- **Dynamic Workflow Orchestration:** Instead of a fixed agent interaction model (e.g., Bull/Bear debate), a `Supervisor` could define the collaboration pattern on the fly. For example:
    - **Low Volatility:** A simple workflow using only the `MarketAnalyst` to generate a report.
    - **High Volatility/News Event:** A complex workflow involving a `NewsAnalysisAgent`, `MarketAnalyst`, `BullResearcher`, `BearResearcher`, and `RiskAnalyst` in a specific sequence to generate a rapid, multi-faceted trade decision.
- **Formalized Agent Pool:** The concept of having specialized, "on-standby" executor agents is a powerful abstraction. It treats our existing agents as a library of capabilities that a supervisor can call upon, rather than a fixed team.
- **Standardized Environmental Perception:** The paper formalizes the process of observing the environment and converting it into a textual context that agents can reason about. We can adopt this by creating a standardized "MarketObservation" module that consolidates price data, news sentiment, on-chain metrics, etc., into a structured input for the `Supervisor`.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| **Supervisor Agent**           | `DeepTraderManager` acts as a static coordinator for a fixed debate. | The manager needs to be evolved to **dynamically select agents** and **define workflows** based on real-time market context.               |
| **Executor Agent Pool**        | A set of specialized agents exists (`BullResearcher`, `MarketAnalyst`). | The pool is used in a fixed structure. A mechanism for the supervisor to dynamically **invoke** agents from the pool on demand is needed.         |
| **Dynamic Workflow Orchestration** | Agent interaction is hardcoded (the Bull/Bear debate format).      | A **workflow engine** is completely missing. The Supervisor needs a way to define and execute different collaboration patterns (e.g., pipelines, feedback loops). |
| **Environmental Perception**     | Agents consume market data and news feeds internally.                | There is no formalized, system-wide `Observation` module that creates a standardized textual context for the Supervisor agent to reason from. |

## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*

- [ ] **Phase 1: Refactor `DeepTraderManager` into a `SupervisorAgent`**
    - [ ] Abstract the core logic of `DeepTraderManager` into a new `SupervisorAgent` class.
    - [ ] Remove the hardcoded Bull/Bear debate orchestration.
    - [ ] Add a new method `analyze_context` to the `SupervisorAgent` that takes a standardized `MarketObservation` object as input.

- [ ] **Phase 2: Develop a Simple Workflow Engine**
    - [ ] Design a basic, serial workflow definition format (e.g., a JSON list of agent names to be called in sequence).
    - [ ] Implement a `WorkflowEngine` that can parse this format and execute the agents in the specified order.
    - [ ] The `SupervisorAgent`'s primary output should be this JSON workflow definition.

- [ ] **Phase 3: Formalize the Agent Pool and `MarketObservation`**
    - [ ] Refactor the agent instantiation logic in `backend/agents/__init__.py` to allow individual agents to be called as "executors" by the `WorkflowEngine`.
    - [ ] Create a Pydantic model for a `MarketObservation` that consolidates key data points (e.g., volatility index, top news sentiment, key price levels).
    - [ ] Create a new tool/service responsible for populating this `MarketObservation` object before a session begins.

- [ ] **Phase 4: Implement a Dynamic Workflow**
    - [ ] Enhance the `SupervisorAgent` to generate at least two different workflows: a "low_volatility_report" workflow and a "high_volatility_trade" workflow, based on the input `MarketObservation`.
    - [ ] Test the full end-to-end flow, from market data input to the execution of the dynamically selected workflow.
