## Executive Summary
The paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for autonomous vehicle on-ramp merging. The key innovation is the use of "zone-specific" global information, provided by a roadside unit (RSU), to supplement the local observations of each agent. This allows for more coordinated and efficient decision-making, combining both lane-changing (discrete) and gap-adjustment (continuous) actions. The system is modeled as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (MA-POMDP) and solved using a Parameterized Deep Q-Network (PDQN).

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **Zone-Specific Market Data:** Instead of vehicles in traffic zones, we can think of "zones" as different market sectors (e.g., DeFi, Memecoins, L1s) or different timeframes (e.g., 1-hour, 4-hour, 1-day). A "Market Overview" agent could act as the RSU, providing summarized data (e.g., sector-wide volume, volatility, sentiment) to the individual trading agents.
- **Hybrid Action Space for Trading:** A trading agent's action space can be modeled as a hybrid of discrete and continuous actions. For example:
    - Discrete actions: `BUY`, `SELL`, `HOLD`.
    - Continuous parameters: The *percentage* of the portfolio to allocate to a trade, or the specific *limit price* for an order.
- **MARL for Portfolio Management:** A team of specialized agents could manage a portfolio, with each agent focusing on a specific market "zone." These agents would learn to coordinate their actions based on both their local observations and the global market summary provided by the Market Overview agent. This could help to optimize portfolio allocation and hedge against sector-specific risks.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Multi-Agent System | The project has a multi-agent architecture with specialized agents (`MarketAnalyst`, `Trader`, etc.). | The agents currently operate in a more siloed fashion. We need a mechanism for them to share global, "zone-specific" context and coordinate their actions in a more tightly-coupled way. |
| Global Context Provider (RSU) | There is no dedicated agent for providing a global market overview. | A new `MarketOverview` agent would need to be created. This agent would be responsible for aggregating and summarizing market data across different sectors and timeframes. |
| Hybrid Action Space | The current action space for trading agents is likely discrete (e.g., `execute_trade`). | The `Trader` agent would need to be enhanced to support a hybrid action space, allowing it to take continuous parameters for its trades (e.g., trade size, limit price). |
| Reinforcement Learning | The project is set up for autonomous agents, but the specific learning mechanism is not detailed in the provided documentation. | A reinforcement learning framework (e.g., using a library like `stable-baselines3` or `RLlib`) would need to be integrated to enable the agents to learn from their actions and improve their strategies over time. |

## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*

- [ ] Task 1: Create a new `MarketOverview` agent responsible for aggregating and disseminating zone-specific market data.
- [ ] Task 2: Define the "zones" for the crypto market (e.g., by sector, timeframe).
- [ ] Task 3: Enhance the `Trader` agent to support a hybrid action space, allowing for both discrete actions and continuous parameters.
- [ ] Task 4: Integrate a reinforcement learning framework to train the agent team.
- [ ] Task 5: Design a reward function for the MARL system that balances profitability, risk, and other relevant factors.
- [ ] Task 6: Implement the communication channels between the `MarketOverview` agent and the other agents in the team.
- [ ] Task 7: Develop a simulation environment for training and testing the MARL-based trading system.
