## Executive Summary
The paper introduces AccelOpt, a multi-agent LLM system designed to autonomously optimize low-level compute kernels for new AI accelerators. The system uses a "Planner-Executor-Summarizer" agentic workflow. It explores the optimization space using a beam search algorithm and learns from its experiences by curating an "Optimization Memory" of successful "slow-to-fast" kernel transformations. This allows the system to progressively improve its optimization capabilities without requiring pre-existing, hardware-specific expert knowledge. The core contribution is the concept of a self-improving agent that learns by reflecting on its own performance.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **Concept 1: Self-Improving Strategy Generation.** We can adapt the Planner-Executor-Summarizer workflow for generating and refining trading strategies. The `StrategyAgent` could act as the Planner, the `Trader` as the Executor (simulating or backtesting the trade), and a new `Summarizer` agent could reflect on the outcome to improve future plans.
- **Concept 2: "Optimization Memory" for Trading Heuristics.** The idea of storing "slow-fast pairs" can be directly translated to storing "unprofitable-profitable" trade setups. The `KhalaMemoryToolkit` is the perfect place to store these structured experiences. The Summarizer agent would create generalizable insights (e.g., "Strategy X failed during high market volatility, while Strategy Y succeeded") that are fed back to the Planner.
- **Concept 3: Beam Search for Strategy Exploration.** Instead of reacting to a single user prompt with one path, the `DeepTraderManager` could use beam search to explore multiple potential trading strategies concurrently. It would task the Planner (`StrategyAgent`) to generate N different approaches, have them evaluated, and then continue iterating on the most promising candidates.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agentic Workflow** | We have a team of specialized agents (e.g., `DeepTraderManager`, `MarketAnalyst`). The roles of Planner and Executor can be mapped to existing agents. | A dedicated **`Summarizer` agent** is missing. No current agent is responsible for reflecting on the outcomes of actions and distilling generalizable knowledge. |
| **Learning from Memory** | The `KhalaMemoryToolkit` exists and is used by agents, providing a foundation for storing experiences. | The memory is used for simple data recall. We are missing the **structured "experience" format** (the equivalent of a "slow-fast pair") and the logic for a `Summarizer` to create and store these distilled insights. |
| **Iterative Search** | The system is currently reactive and single-path. It processes one request and generates one response or action. | An **iterative, multi-path search algorithm like Beam Search** is completely absent. The `DeepTraderManager` lacks a mechanism to explore and compare multiple competing strategies before making a decision. |
| **Performance Feedback**| Agents can access market data and portfolio state, providing a basis for performance evaluation. | There is no formalized feedback loop. We need a mechanism to explicitly label a trade or strategy's outcome as "successful" or "unsuccessful" to create the slow-fast pairs for the Optimization Memory. |


## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*

- [ ] **Phase 1: Create the Summarizer Agent.**
    - [ ] Define the `Summarizer` agent in a new directory (`backend/Summarizer/`).
    - [ ] Write instructions (`instructions.md`) for the agent, tasking it with analyzing the outcome of a trade and producing a generalizable insight.
    - [ ] Create a `SummarizationToolkit` with a tool, `summarize_trade_outcome(initial_state, final_state, strategy, outcome)`.

- [ ] **Phase 2: Enhance the Memory System.**
    - [ ] Define a Pydantic model in `backend/protocol.py` named `StrategyExperience` to structure the "unprofitable-profitable" pairs, including the summary from the `Summarizer`.
    - [ ] Add functions to `KhalaMemoryToolkit` to specifically add and retrieve `StrategyExperience` objects.

- [ ] **Phase 3: Implement the Self-Improving Loop.**
    - [ ] Modify the `DeepTraderManager`'s primary logic to incorporate the new workflow.
    - [ ] After the `Trader` executes a strategy, the `DeepTraderManager` should call the `Summarizer` agent to analyze the result.
    - [ ] The `DeepTraderManager` will then use the `KhalaMemoryToolkit` to store the resulting `StrategyExperience`.
    - [ ] Update the `StrategyAgent`'s (Planner) prompt to include a section for "Past Experiences" retrieved from the memory, so it can learn from its mistakes and successes.

- [ ] **Phase 4 (Advanced): Introduce Beam Search.**
    - [ ] Refactor the `DeepTraderManager`'s chat handler to implement a beam search loop.
    - [ ] Instead of running a single strategy, it will generate `N` plans from the `StrategyAgent`, simulate/evaluate them, and keep the top `B` candidates for the next iteration of refinement.
