# Proposal for Implementing Agent Cards for CryptoSentinel Agents

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a plan to implement a structured documentation format for each of the 12 AI agents in the CryptoSentinel system. The proposed format is based on the "Agent Card" concept from the research paper "The AI Agent Index" (2502.01635), which provides a framework for documenting the capabilities, limitations, and safety features of agentic AI systems.

Adopting this format will provide the following benefits:

*   **Improved Transparency:** A clear and consistent way to understand what each agent does.
*   **Enhanced Safety:** Explicitly documenting agent-specific guardrails and safety protocols.
*   **Better Onboarding:** New developers can quickly understand the roles and responsibilities of each agent.
*   **More Effective Auditing:** A structured format for reviewing and auditing agent behavior.

## 2. Proposed "Agent Card" Structure

The following Markdown template will be used for each agent. It is adapted from the "Agent Card" framework to fit the internal context of the CryptoSentinel project.

```markdown
# Agent Card: [Agent Name]

## 1. Basic Information
*   **Name:** [e.g., MarketAnalyst]
*   **Role:** [A brief, one-sentence description of the agent's primary function]
*   **Intended Uses:** [What is this agent designed to do?]

## 2. System Components
*   **Backend Model:** [What model(s) are used to power the system? (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Flash)]
*   **Reasoning, Planning, and Memory Implementation:** [How does the agent 'think'? How does it use `khala-agentmemory`?]
*   **Observation Space:** [What is the agent able to observe while 'thinking'? (e.g., real-time market data, news feeds)]
*   **Action Space/Tools:** [What direct actions can the agent take? (A list of its tools)]

## 3. Guardrails and Oversight
*   **Controls and Guardrails:** [What notable methods are used to protect against harmful actions? (e.g., trade limits, query restrictions)]
*   **Monitoring and Shutdown Procedures:** [How is this agent monitored? What are the procedures for shutting it down in case of malfunction?]

## 4. Evaluations
*   **Notable Benchmark Evaluations:** [Performance on any relevant benchmarks]
*   **Bespoke Testing:** [Demos, simulations, or other custom tests]
*   **Safety:** [Results of any safety evaluations or red-teaming]

## 5. Ecosystem
*   **Interoperability with Other Agents:** [How does this agent interact with other agents in the system?]
```

## 3. Implementation Plan

1.  **Create a New Directory:** A new directory will be created at `docs/agents` to house the "Agent Card" documentation for each agent.
2.  **Create Individual Agent Files:** For each of the 12 agents in the CryptoSentinel system, a new Markdown file will be created in the `docs/agents` directory (e.g., `docs/agents/MarketAnalyst.md`).
3.  **Populate Agent Cards:** Each file will be populated with the "Agent Card" template. The known information for each agent will be filled in, and any missing information will be clearly marked as "TODO" or "Unknown."
4.  **Update Main Documentation:** The main architecture document (`docs/03-architecture.md`) will be updated to link to the new "Agent Card" documentation in `docs/agents`.

## 4. List of Agents to be Documented

The following 12 agents will have "Agent Cards" created for them:

1.  `AnalistaDeSentimento`
2.  `AnalistaFundamentalista`
3.  `AssetManager`
4.  `ComplianceOfficer`
5.  `DeepTraderManager`
6.  `Dev`
7.  `LearningCoordinator`
8.  `MarketAnalyst`
9.  `PortfolioManager`
10. `RiskAnalyst`
11. `StrategyAgent`
12. `Trader`

## 5. Next Steps

*   Gather the missing information for each agent by consulting with the development team and reviewing the codebase in more detail.
*   Complete the "Agent Card" documentation for each agent.
*   Integrate the "Agent Card" information into the frontend `AgentTeam` component to provide a more detailed view of each agent's capabilities.
