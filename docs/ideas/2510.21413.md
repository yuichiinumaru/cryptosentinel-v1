## Executive Summary
This paper investigates the adoption, content, structure, and evolution of AI configuration files, primarily `AGENTS.md`, in open-source software projects. The core finding is that while adoption is still nascent (around 5%), these files are becoming a critical artifact for **context engineering**—the practice of providing AI agents with the necessary information to perform tasks effectively.

The study reveals a lack of standardized structure in these files, but identifies common categories of information, including coding conventions, contribution guidelines, and architecture descriptions. It also highlights the varied writing styles used (descriptive, prescriptive, prohibitive), suggesting that developers are actively experimenting with how to best communicate with AI agents. The paper concludes that `AGENTS.md` files should be treated as living software artifacts, co-evolving with the codebase, and proposes that studying them offers a unique window into real-world prompt and context engineering.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **Formalize `AGENTS.md` Structure:** Adopt a more standardized structure based on the common categories identified in the paper's findings (Table 1). This would make our `AGENTS.md` more predictable and effective for AI agents. Key sections to ensure are top-level: `Conventions/Best Practices`, `Contribution Guidelines`, `Architecture`, `Build Commands`, and `Testing Instructions`.
- **Adopt Explicit Instruction Styles:** Leverage the paper's identification of different writing styles (prescriptive, prohibitive, explanatory). We can make our directives clearer by using strong imperatives (e.g., "MUST," "ALWAYS") for rules and prohibitions ("MUST NOT," "NEVER") for critical constraints, especially for security and testing.
- **Institute a Co-evolution Policy:** The paper highlights the co-evolution of `AGENTS.md` with source code. We should formalize this by making it a requirement in our contribution guidelines that any PR modifying architecture, dependencies, or workflows must include a corresponding update to `AGENTS.md`.
- **Scoped `AGENTS.md` Files:** The paper discusses the potential for module-level configuration files. We could introduce scoped `AGENTS.md` files in `backend/` and `src/` to provide more granular context for tasks specific to those domains, while leaving the root file for project-wide directives.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standardized Structure** | Our `AGENTS.md` has a good structure but could be better aligned with the paper's findings. For example, `Build Commands` and `Testing Instructions` are not explicitly separated. | Reorganize the file to more closely match the common structure observed in the study to improve agent comprehension. |
| **Explicit Writing Style** | The current `AGENTS.md` uses a mix of styles implicitly. "Immutable Laws" are strongly worded, but other sections are more descriptive. | A conscious effort to use prescriptive (`MUST`) and prohibitive (`NEVER`) language would reduce ambiguity for the agent. |
| **Co-evolution Policy** | No formal policy exists. Updates to `AGENTS.md` are performed on an ad-hoc basis. | Add a section to the contribution guidelines mandating updates to `AGENTS.md` when relevant systems change. |
| **Scoped Configuration** | Only a single, root-level `AGENTS.md` is in use. | Potential to add `backend/AGENTS.md` and `src/AGENTS.md` to provide more focused context and avoid cluttering the root file. |

## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*

- [ ] Task 1: Create a new task in `docs/02-tasks.md` to refactor the root `AGENTS.md` based on the structure identified in the paper.
- [ ] Task 2: Create a new task to review and update the language in `AGENTS.md` to be more explicit (prescriptive/prohibitive).
- [ ] Task 3: Create a new task to update the project's contribution guidelines to include the `AGENTS.md` co-evolution policy.
- [ ] Task 4: Create a new task to research the feasibility and benefit of implementing scoped `AGENTS.md` files for the backend and frontend.
