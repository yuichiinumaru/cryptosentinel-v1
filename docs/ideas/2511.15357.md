## Executive Summary
The paper introduces a "Cost-Aware Prediction" (CAP) framework, which combines a machine learning model, a cost-benefit analysis visualization tool (Clinical Impact Projection or CIP curves), and a set of four LLM agents to provide interpretable and transparent decision support. While the paper's use case is in the medical domain—predicting 1-year mortality in heart failure patients—the core concepts of the CAP framework are highly transferable to the domain of cryptocurrency trading. By adapting the framework to the financial context, we can enhance the CryptoSentinel system with a more nuanced, risk-aware approach to trading decisions.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **Cost-Aware Prediction (CAP) for Trading:** The fundamental idea of the CAP framework can be adapted to make risk-aware trading decisions. Instead of clinical outcomes, the model would predict financial outcomes, such as the probability of an asset reaching a certain price within a given timeframe. The "cost" in this context would be redefined to represent financial risks and trading costs.
- **Financial Impact Projection (FIP) Curves:** The paper's CIP curves can be repurposed as Financial Impact Projection (FIP) curves. These curves would visualize the trade-offs between different financial metrics. For example, instead of "Quality of Life," we could use "Portfolio Health" (e.g., Sharpe ratio, max drawdown), and instead of "Healthcare System Cost," we could use "Trading Costs" (e.g., transaction fees, slippage).
- **LLM Agents for Trade Explanation:** The paper's four LLM agents can serve as a model for developing a similar set of agents within CryptoSentinel. These agents would be responsible for explaining the reasoning behind trading decisions, interpreting the FIP curves, and suggesting actions to mitigate risks.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Predictive ML Model | The project has several analyst agents (e.g., `MarketAnalyst`, `AnalistaFundamentalista`) that perform various types of analysis, but it lacks a dedicated, cost-aware predictive model that integrates a cost-benefit framework. | A new ML model needs to be developed to predict asset price movements while incorporating a cost-benefit analysis. This model would need to be trained on historical market data and financial metrics. |
| Cost-Benefit Visualization | The current frontend provides a dashboard for monitoring agent activity, but it does not have any tools for visualizing the cost-benefit trade-offs of trading decisions. | A new component needs to be designed and implemented to generate and display FIP curves. This would likely involve creating a new service in the backend and a new visualization component in the frontend. |
| LLM Agents for Explanation | The project has a well-defined multi-agent architecture, but no agents are specifically designed to explain the cost-benefit analysis of their predictions. | The existing agent framework can be extended to include new agents that can provide detailed, natural language explanations of trading decisions, incorporating the FIP analysis. These agents would be similar to the ones described in the paper, but tailored to the financial domain. |

## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*
