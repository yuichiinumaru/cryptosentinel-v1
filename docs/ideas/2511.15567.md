## Executive Summary
The paper introduces a framework where a "Coder" agent generates user interfaces (UIs) and a "Computer-Use Agent" (CUA) acts as a "Judge" to evaluate them. This Coder-CUA collaboration shifts UI design from being human-centric to agent-centric, optimizing for task success rate and reliability rather than aesthetics. The authors introduce AUI-Gym, a benchmark for automatic GUI development, and a CUA Dashboard to provide concise, actionable feedback. The core idea is that an agent (CUA) tests the environment created by another agent (Coder) and provides feedback for iterative improvement, making the environment itself dynamic.

## Idea Brainstorming
While CryptoSentinel is not a UI generation project, the core concept of an agent-driven feedback loop is highly applicable. We can adapt this "Coder-CUA" dynamic to the domain of cryptocurrency trading strategy development.

- **Concept 1: Strategy Developer & Strategy Auditor Agents:**
  - Create a new `StrategyDeveloper` agent (the "Coder") responsible for generating trading strategies based on market data and indicators.
  - Create a new `StrategyAuditor` agent (the "CUA/Judge") responsible for rigorously backtesting and evaluating the strategies generated by the `StrategyDeveloper`.

- **Concept 2: Backtesting Toolkit as the "Environment":**
  - Develop a `BacktestingToolkit` that allows the `StrategyAuditor` to simulate the performance of a proposed trading strategy against historical market data. This toolkit would be the "tunable environment" from the paper.
  - The toolkit would output performance metrics like Profit/Loss, Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown, etc.

- **Concept 3: "Strategy Dashboard" for Feedback:**
  - Similar to the CUA Dashboard, the `StrategyAuditor` can generate a "Strategy Dashboard" or a structured report. This report would summarize the backtesting results and provide specific, actionable feedback to the `StrategyDeveloper` (e.g., "The stop-loss at 5% is too tight for this asset's volatility, leading to premature exits. Suggest widening to 8%.").

## Gap Analysis
Comparing the paper's concepts to the current CryptoSentinel codebase reveals the following:

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Generative Agent ("Coder")** | The system has various agents (`MarketAnalyst`, `Trader`), but none are explicitly designed to *generate and refine* trading strategies as a primary function. | A dedicated `StrategyDeveloper` agent with the ability to create and iteratively modify trading strategies based on feedback. |
| **Evaluator Agent ("CUA/Judge")** | No equivalent agent exists. The current `RiskAnalyst` agent evaluates risk *post-trade* or on existing positions, but doesn't systematically audit newly generated strategies. | A `StrategyAuditor` agent that can systematically evaluate trading strategies before deployment. |
| **Testing Environment** | The `DexToolkit` allows for live interaction with blockchains, and `MarketDataToolkit` can fetch historical data, but there is no dedicated, sandboxed backtesting environment. | A `BacktestingToolkit` that can simulate trades against historical data without risking real assets. This is a critical missing piece. |
| **Feedback Mechanism** | Agent communication is present, but there's no formal, structured feedback loop for iterative refinement of complex artifacts like trading strategies. | A structured data format (the "Strategy Dashboard") for the `StrategyAuditor` to report findings to the `StrategyDeveloper`. |

## Implementation Plan
*This plan is a high-level proposal for a new feature based on the paper's ideas, not for immediate implementation.*

- [ ] **Task 1: Develop `BacktestingToolkit`.**
  - Create a new toolkit in `backend/tools/` that can:
    - Load historical market data (OHLCV).
    - Simulate the execution of trading signals (buy, sell, hold).
    - Calculate and return key performance indicators (KPIs).
- [ ] **Task 2: Implement `StrategyDeveloper` Agent.**
  - Create a new agent in `backend/agents/` that can:
    - Receive high-level trading goals (e.g., "Develop a high-frequency scalping strategy for ETH/USDC").
    - Generate a formal representation of a trading strategy (e.g., as a JSON object with entry/exit conditions, risk parameters).
    - Pass the strategy to the `StrategyAuditor`.
    - Revise the strategy based on feedback.
- [ ] **Task 3: Implement `StrategyAuditor` Agent.**
  - Create a new agent in `backend/agents/` that can:
    - Receive a trading strategy from the `StrategyDeveloper`.
    - Use the `BacktestingToolkit` to evaluate the strategy.
    - Analyze the results and generate a structured "Strategy Dashboard" report.
    - Send the report back to the `StrategyDeveloper`.
- [ ] **Task 4: Integrate the new workflow.**
  - Modify the agent orchestration layer (`backend/agents/__init__.py`) to support the new collaborative workflow between the `StrategyDeveloper` and `StrategyAuditor`.
