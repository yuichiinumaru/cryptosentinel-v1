## Executive Summary
The paper introduces "DeepDebater," a multi-agent system designed to compete in full-length, American-style policy debates. The system utilizes a hierarchical architecture of specialized multi-agent workflows. Teams of LLM-powered agents collaborate and critique each other's work to perform discrete argumentative tasks, such as generating plans, advantages, and rebuttals. The system is grounded in a massive, curated corpus of policy debate evidence. In simulated rounds, DeepDebater consistently outperforms human-authored cases and arguments as adjudicated by an autonomous judge.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **Hierarchical Multi-Agent Workflows:** The paper's core contribution is its hierarchical structure. A high-level agent directs specialized sub-teams of agents. This could be directly applied to CryptoSentinel. For instance, a `ChiefStrategist` agent could analyze the overall market and decide on a high-level strategy (e.g., "risk-off," "accumulate ETH," "speculate on altcoins"). It would then delegate the execution of this strategy to more specialized agents.
- **Deeply Specialized Agent Roles:** DeepDebater uses highly specialized agents for very specific tasks (e.g., generating arguments about "Harms," "Inherency," "Solvency"). CryptoSentinel could adopt a similar model, creating agents that specialize in areas like `On-chainAnalysis`, `SocialMediaSentimentAnalysis`, `MacroEconomicIndicatorAnalysis`, `TechnicalAnalysis`, etc.
- **Agent Collaboration and Critique:** DeepDebater's agents critique each other's outputs. This is a powerful mechanism for self-correction and improvement. A `ReviewerAgent` could be introduced into the CryptoSentinel agent team to validate the findings and proposals of other agents before any action is taken. This would improve the robustness of the system.
- **Curated Evidence Corpus:** The system's reasoning is grounded in a large, high-quality, curated corpus of evidence. CryptoSentinel could benefit from a similar approach. Instead of relying on real-time, and potentially noisy, data for all its reasoning, it could use a curated database of market analyses, historical on-chain data, and reputable news sources to inform its decisions.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Hierarchical Agent Structure | The current agent team is relatively flat. Agents like `DeepTraderManager` orchestrate, but there is no explicit hierarchy. | A clear hierarchical structure with a high-level `ChiefStrategist` agent is missing. |
| Deep Agent Specialization | The project has some specialized agents (e.g., `MarketAnalyst`, `RiskAnalyst`), but not to the granular level of DeepDebater. | More specialized agents for specific domains of analysis (on-chain, social media, macroeconomics) are needed. |
| Agent Collaboration & Critique | There is no formal mechanism for agents to critique or validate each other's work. | A `ReviewerAgent` or a similar mechanism for cross-agent validation is needed. |
| Curated Evidence Corpus | `khala-agentmemory` serves as a general-purpose memory, but it's not a curated, high-quality evidence corpus. | A dedicated, curated corpus of financial and market data, and a system for ingesting and retrieving from it, is needed. |

## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*

- [ ] **Phase 1: Introduce Hierarchy**
    - [ ] Design and implement a `ChiefStrategist` agent responsible for setting the high-level trading strategy.
    - [ ] Refactor the `AgentFactory` to create the `ChiefStrategist` and have it orchestrate the other agents.
- [ ] **Phase 2: Deepen Specialization**
    - [ ] Create a new `OnChainAnalysisToolkit` with tools for analyzing on-chain data.
    - [ ] Create a new `OnChainAnalyst` agent that uses this toolkit.
    - [ ] Create a new `SocialMediaSentimentToolkit` with tools for analyzing sentiment from social media platforms.
    - [ ] Create a new `SocialMediaSentimentAnalyst` agent that uses this toolkit.
- [ ] **Phase 3: Implement Critique Mechanism**
    - [ ] Design and implement a `ReviewerAgent` that receives proposals from other agents and validates them against a set of rules and constraints.
    - [ ] Integrate the `ReviewerAgent` into the main agent workflow, requiring its approval before any trade is executed.
- [ ] **Phase 4: Build Curated Corpus**
    - [ ] Design a schema for a curated evidence corpus within `khala-agentmemory`.
    - [ ] Develop scripts and processes for ingesting high-quality data (e.g., Glassnode reports, Messari analyses, etc.) into the corpus.
    - [ ] Refactor existing agents to query this curated corpus before fetching real-time data.
