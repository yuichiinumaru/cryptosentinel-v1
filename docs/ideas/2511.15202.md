## Executive Summary
The SOLID framework integrates mathematical optimization with Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve decision-making. It uses a coordinator agent and an iterative process inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The coordinator uses dual prices and deviation penalties to guide a quantitative optimization agent and a qualitative LLM agent toward a consensus, leveraging the strengths of both to achieve a more robust outcome than either could alone.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **Coordinator Agent:** The existing `DeepTraderManager` agent can be adapted to serve as the SOLID coordinator. It would manage the iterative process, update the dual prices (`lambda`), and calculate the public decision variable (`x`).
- **Optimization Agent:** The `BullResearcher` could be repurposed as the quantitative optimization agent, focusing on models like Markowitz Mean-Variance as described in the paper. It would need to incorporate the augmented utility function from the SOLID framework.
- **LLM Agent:** The `BearResearcher` could be adapted to act as the qualitative LLM agent. Its prompting would need to be updated to understand the dual prices and deviation penalties to make context-aware decisions.
- **Data Input:** The `MarketDataToolkit` can provide the quantitative data for the optimization agent. A new tool might be needed to fetch qualitative data (like news summaries) for the LLM agent.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Coordinator Agent** | `DeepTraderManager` exists but only facilitates a simple debate. | Needs to be enhanced to implement the full ADMM-style iterative loop, including dual price updates and public decision variable calculations. |
| **Optimization Agent** | `BullResearcher` exists and performs quantitative analysis. | Needs to be modified to accept dual prices and deviation penalties as inputs to its decision-making process (augmented utility function). |
| **LLM Agent** | `BearResearcher` exists and performs qualitative analysis. | Requires significant prompt engineering to understand and react to the economic signals (dual prices) from the coordinator. |
| **Iterative Process** | The current process is a single-pass debate. | A multi-turn, iterative process that continues until convergence (or a max number of iterations) needs to be implemented. |
| **Data Privacy** | The current system doesn't explicitly address data privacy between agents. | The modular nature of the proposed integration aligns with the paper's data privacy benefits. |

## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*

- [ ] Task 1: Enhance `DeepTraderManager` to act as a SOLID coordinator.
- [ ] Task 2: Adapt `BullResearcher` to function as the optimization agent with an augmented utility function.
- [ ] Task 3: Re-engineer the prompts for `BearResearcher` to act as the LLM agent.
- [ ] Task 4: Implement the iterative loop within the `DeepTraderManager`.
- [ ] Task 5: (Optional) Create a new tool for fetching qualitative news data.
