## Executive Summary
The paper introduces "Octopus," a multi-agent reasoning framework that enhances multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by orchestrating six fundamental capabilities: fine-grained visual perception, visual augmentation, spatial/geometric understanding, logical programming, visual transformation, and visual creation. The core idea is to move beyond monolithic tool-driven approaches to a more flexible, human-like reasoning process where the agent first selects a high-level capability and then chooses a specific tool to execute. This capability-first approach allows the agent to dynamically adapt its strategy, leading to more robust and accurate solutions for complex multimodal tasks.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **Capability-First Orchestration:** Instead of having a flat list of tools, we can group them into high-level capabilities. For example, `DexToolkit` and `SecurityToolkit` could fall under a "On-Chain Analysis" capability, while `TechnicalAnalysisToolkit` and `MarketRegimeToolkit` could be part of a "Quantitative Analysis" capability. This would allow the `DeepTraderManager` to reason at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., "I need to perform on-chain analysis") before selecting a specific tool.
- **Dynamic Tool Composition:** The Octopus framework allows for the dynamic composition of tools based on the selected capability. We could adapt this by creating a "CapabilityManager" that presents a curated list of tools to the agent based on the current context and the high-level capability selected. This would simplify the agent's decision-making process and reduce the risk of selecting inappropriate tools.
- **Visual Augmentation for Analysis:** The concept of visual augmentation can be translated into generating charts, graphs, or other visualizations as intermediate steps in the reasoning process. For instance, the `TechnicalAnalysisToolkit` could generate a price chart with indicators, and the agent could then reason based on this visual output. This would be a powerful way to externalize the agent's reasoning process and potentially improve its accuracy.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tool Diversity** | The project has a wide range of tools in `backend/tools`, covering on-chain analysis, quantitative metrics, market data, etc. | The tools are presented as a flat list to the agent, without any hierarchical organization. |
| **Agentic Reasoning** | The `DeepTraderManager` and other agents already exhibit agentic behavior, making decisions and using tools to achieve their goals. | The reasoning process is tool-centric, not capability-centric. The agent has to choose from a large number of tools, which can be inefficient. |
| **Visual Generation** | There is no capability to generate visual artifacts like charts or graphs as part of the reasoning process. | A new `VisualizationToolkit` would be needed to generate and interpret visual data. |
| **Multimodal Reasoning** | The current system is text-based. It can process numerical data from APIs but does not have a concept of visual reasoning. | The ability to process and reason about images (e.g., charts) would be a significant new feature. |

## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*

- [ ] **Task 1: Introduce Capability Layer:**
    - [ ] Define a set of capabilities relevant to the CryptoSentinel project (e.g., "On-Chain Analysis," "Quantitative Analysis," "Market Research").
    - [ ] Create a `CapabilityManager` that maps each capability to a set of tools from the `backend/tools` directory.
    - [ ] Modify the agent's prompt to encourage capability-first reasoning (e.g., "First, choose a capability. Then, select a tool from that capability.").
- [ ] **Task 2: Develop a VisualizationToolkit:**
    - [ ] Create a new `VisualizationToolkit` in `backend/tools/visualization.py`.
    - [ ] Implement tools to generate charts and graphs using a library like `matplotlib` or `plotly`.
    - [ ] Add a tool to the `DeepTraderManager` that allows it to interpret the generated images (this would require a multimodal LLM).
- [ ] **Task 3: Update Agent Logic:**
    - [ ] Modify the `DeepTraderManager` to interact with the `CapabilityManager` and the `VisualizationToolkit`.
    - [ ] Update the agent's instructions to guide it on how to use the new capabilities and tools.
- [ ] **Task 4: Add Multimodal Support:**
    - [ ] Integrate a multimodal LLM (like GPT-4o, which is already in use) to enable the agent to "see" and interpret the generated charts.
    - [ ] Update the data flow to handle both text and image data.
