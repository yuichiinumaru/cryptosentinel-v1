## Executive Summary
The paper evaluates the effectiveness of adversarial attacks on autonomous driving agents, moving beyond isolated ML models to assess the entire agent pipeline. The key finding is that a holistic, system-level evaluation is critical. While adversarial patches could successfully mislead a core ML model's predictions (e.g., for steering or stopping), the final action of the vehicle was often corrected by non-ML components like PID controllers or GPS-based rules. This demonstrates that a defense-in-depth architecture, where secondary, rule-based systems validate or override primary ML outputs, provides significant resilience against adversarial attacks.

## Idea Brainstorming
The core concept applicable to CryptoSentinel is the validation of this defense-in-depth strategy against adversarial manipulation. In our context, this isn't about physical patches, but about adversarial *prompts* or manipulated data inputs.

- **Concept 1: Holistic System-Level Security.** An attack on a single agent's LLM is not enough to compromise the entire system if other agents or hard-coded rules act as a failsafe. The paper's findings strongly validate our multi-agent architecture where agents like `RiskAnalyst` and `ComplianceOfficer` serve the same function as the PID controllers in the driving agents.
- **Concept 2: Threat Model Expansion.** We should expand our threat model to consider not just attacks on the LLM of one agent, but coordinated attacks that attempt to bypass the entire pipeline. The paper suggests attackers might leverage knowledge of the agent's code or configuration, which in our case means an attacker might try to craft a prompt that satisfies the `MarketAnalyst` while also bypassing the checks from the `RiskAnalyst`.
- **Concept 3: Standardized "Red Team" Benchmarking.** The paper proposes a CARLA-based leaderboard for adversarial robustness. We could adapt this idea by creating a suite of "adversarial scenarios" in our integration tests. These tests would simulate malicious user prompts or manipulated market data designed to trick the agent team into making bad trades, allowing us to quantify the robustness of our guardrails.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Holistic Defense** | The multi-agent architecture (`DeepTraderManager` coordinating `MarketAnalyst`, `RiskAnalyst`, etc.) and hard-coded rules in `AGENTS.md` provide a strong foundation for defense-in-depth. | The interaction between agents is still emergent. We lack explicit, formal verification steps between agent handoffs. For example, the `Trader` agent currently trusts the output from the `StrategyAgent` implicitly. |
| **Expanded Threat Model** | Our current security model is primarily focused on classic software vulnerabilities (API key security, etc.) and basic prompt injection on single agents. | We do not have a formal threat model for multi-agent collusion or sophisticated adversarial prompts that are designed to specifically bypass our existing multi-layer defenses. |
| **Robustness Benchmarking** | We have unit and integration tests (`backend/tests/`), but they primarily test for functional correctness ("happy path") and basic failures. | We are missing a dedicated suite of adversarial tests ("red team" tests) that explicitly try to break the system's security rules and measure resilience. We have no metrics to score the system's robustness against adversarial attacks. |

## Implementation Plan
*This is a research task, so the implementation plan is a proposal for future work, not immediate code changes.*

- [ ] **Task 1: Formalize Inter-Agent Verification.** Introduce a formal verification step/tool. Before the `Trader` agent executes a trade proposed by the `StrategyAgent`, it must explicitly call a `ComplianceToolkit.verify_trade(trade_proposal)` function which checks against the rules in `AGENTS.md` and the latest `RiskAnalyst` assessment.
- [ ] **Task 2: Develop an Adversarial Prompt Test Suite.** Create a new pytest file, `backend/tests/test_adversarial_scenarios.py`. This suite will contain tests with prompts designed to:
    - [ ] Induce the `MarketAnalyst` to recommend a trade that violates risk parameters.
    - [ ] Attempt to bypass the `SecurityToolkit`'s honeypot detection.
    - [ ] Trick the `Debate` agents into a false consensus.
- [ ] **Task 3: Document the Expanded Threat Model.** Create a new document, `docs/07-security-threat-model.md`, that outlines the potential adversarial attack vectors against the multi-agent system, drawing inspiration from the paper's holistic approach. This document will serve as a guide for future security enhancements.
