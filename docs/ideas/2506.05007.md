## Executive Summary
The paper proposes QiMeng, a system for fully automated hardware and software design for processor chips. It uses a domain-specific Large Processor Chip Model (LPCM) and specialized agents (Hardware and Software Design Agents) that employ a dual-loop feedback mechanism for inference. The inner loop ensures functional correctness through verification and repair, while the outer loop optimizes for performance. This allows the system to autonomously generate, verify, and optimize complex designs.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **Domain-Specific Model:** Develop a "Large Financial Model" (LFM) trained on financial data, trading literature, and market analysis. This model could be multimodal to process text (news, reports) and graph-like data (price charts, order books).
- **Feedback-Driven Strategy Generation:** Adapt the dual-loop feedback concept to the `StrategyAgent`:
    - **Inner Loop (Strategy Soundness):** The agent generates a trading strategy and then uses backtesting, simulation, and risk management rules to verify its logical soundness and safety. If a flaw is found, the agent iteratively repairs it.
    - **Outer Loop (Profitability Optimization):** The agent takes a sound strategy and optimizes its performance (e.g., profitability, Sharpe ratio). It could use paper trading, A/B testing, and other performance metrics as feedback to guide the optimization.
- **Agent Roles:** Enhance the `StrategyAgent` to become a "Strategy Generation Agent" that uses the dual-loop feedback mechanism. The `Trader` agent remains the "Strategy Execution Agent".

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Autonomous Strategy Generation | `StrategyAgent` exists but is not autonomous. | An autonomous, iterative, feedback-driven mechanism for strategy generation and optimization. |
| Strategy Soundness Verification | Backtesting and risk management tools exist. | An autonomous "generate-verify-repair" capability in the `StrategyAgent`. |
| Strategy Performance Optimization | Optimization tools exist. | A closed-loop system for the `StrategyAgent` to deploy strategies in a simulated environment, monitor performance, and autonomously propose and test improvements. |
| Domain-Specific Model | General-purpose LLM. | A "Large Financial Model" (LFM). This is a long-term goal; can be partially bridged with advanced prompting and RAG. |

## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*

- [ ] Task 1: Enhance the `StrategyAgent` to include a "generate-verify-repair" loop for strategy soundness.
- [ ] Task 2: Enhance the `StrategyAgent` to include a "deploy-monitor-optimize" loop for performance optimization.
- [ ] Task 3: Develop a more sophisticated knowledge base for the `StrategyAgent` to use for RAG, to simulate a domain-specific model.
- [ ] Task 4: Create a new agent, `StrategyOptimizer`, to handle the performance optimization loop, separating concerns from the `StrategyGenerator`.
- [ ] Task 5: Investigate the creation of a "Large Financial Model" (LFM).
