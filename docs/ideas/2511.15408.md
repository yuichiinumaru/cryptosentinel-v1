## Executive Summary
The paper introduces NAMeGEn, a novel multi-agent framework designed for Creative Natural Language Generation (CNLG) tasks that require balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives. The system uses a three-agent architecture—a Multi-Objective Manager (MOM), a Multi-Objective Generator (MOG), and a Multi-Objective Evaluator (MOE)—to iteratively generate and refine content. The MOM breaks down tasks into explicit and implicit goals, the MOG creates the content, and the MOE scores the output and provides feedback for refinement. This training-free, dynamic optimization process allows the framework to produce high-quality, creative text that adheres to personalized, fine-grained user requirements while also ensuring accuracy and clarity in its explanations.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **Concept 1: Multi-Objective Trade Strategy Generation:** The NAMeGEn framework could be repurposed from generating creative text to generating and optimizing cryptocurrency trading strategies. The multi-objective approach is a perfect fit for balancing competing financial goals.
    - **Explicit User-specified Objectives (EUOs):** Maximize Sharpe Ratio, Minimize Max Drawdown, Target a specific risk/reward profile, Adhere to asset constraints (e.g., only top 100 coins).
    - **Implicit Interpretive Objectives (IIOs):** Ensure the strategy logic is explainable and transparent, verify the strategy is not overfitted, confirm the logic is robust across different market conditions.
- **Concept 2: Dynamic Agent Team for Enhanced Market Analysis:** The core MOM-MOG-MOE loop can be directly applied to the existing `DeepTraderManager` and its research agents to create more robust and well-vetted market analysis reports before any trade is executed.
    - `MarketAnalysisManager` (MOM): Acts as the primary orchestrator, taking a high-level goal (e.g., "Assess the breakout potential of BTC") and defining clear objectives for the team (e.g., "Analyze on-chain data," "Evaluate recent market sentiment," "Identify key resistance levels," "Provide a bull and bear case").
    - `Bull/Bear Researchers` (MOG): These existing agents would act as generators, fetching data and producing their respective analyses based on the objectives set by the MOM.
    - `DebateCoordinator` as `RiskEvaluator` (MOE): The coordinator's role could be enhanced to become a formal evaluator. Instead of just facilitating a debate, it would score the generated bull/bear cases against the initial objectives and provide structured feedback, forcing the researchers to refine their points until a comprehensive and balanced final report is achieved.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Multi-Agent Framework | The project is built on the `Agno` framework and already features a "debate" team with `BullResearcher`, `BearResearcher`, and a `DebateCoordinator`. | The specific **iterative refinement loop** of Manager-Generator-Evaluator (MOM, MOG, MOE) is not present. The current system is more of a multi-perspective analysis rather than a dynamic optimization of a single output. |
| Objective Decomposition | The `DeepTraderManager` implicitly defines tasks for its sub-agents. | A formal **Multi-Objective Manager (MOM)** agent that explicitly defines, weights, and manages a set of dynamic goals for a task is missing. This would make the system's reasoning more transparent and controllable. |
| Generative Component | The system primarily analyzes existing data to form conclusions. | A dedicated **Multi-Objective Generator (MOG)** agent that can synthesize information from diverse tools to create a *new artifact* (like a novel trading strategy or a structured report) based on a set of goals is not fully realized. |
| Iterative Evaluation & Refinement | The debate format provides a form of evaluation, but it is not a formal, iterative process designed to converge on a quantitatively scored optimal solution. | A dedicated **Multi-Objective Evaluator (MOE)** agent that scores an output against predefined criteria and provides structured, actionable feedback for regeneration is the key missing component to enable the dynamic optimization loop. |

## Implementation Plan
*This is a research task only. The following is a conceptual plan for future implementation.*

- [ ] **Design `ObjectiveManager` Agent:** Create a new agent responsible for decomposing high-level goals (e.g., "find a trade") into a structured set of explicit and implicit objectives with corresponding weights (e.g., `{goal: "maximize_sharpe", weight: 0.7}, {goal: "minimize_drawdown", weight: 0.3}, {goal: "ensure_explainability", weight: 1.0}`).
- [ ] **Enhance `StrategyAgent` as Generator:** Adapt the existing `StrategyAgent` to function as the MOG. It would take the objectives from the `ObjectiveManager` and use its tools to generate a candidate trading strategy.
- [ ] **Create `StrategyEvaluator` Agent:** Build a new MOE agent that scores the generated strategy against the objectives provided by the `ObjectiveManager`. It would output a score and detailed feedback for improvement (e.g., "Sharpe Ratio is below target," "Explanation is unclear").
- [ ] **Orchestrate the Loop:** Modify the `DeepTraderManager` to orchestrate the MOM-MOG-MOE workflow. It would initiate the process, pass objectives to the Generator, pass the generated strategy to the Evaluator, and decide whether to accept the result or loop for refinement based on the evaluation score.
- [ ] **Develop Evaluation Tools:** Create new tools for the `StrategyEvaluator` to use, such as a `backtesting_tool` to calculate financial metrics and an `llm_clarity_check_tool` to assess the quality of the strategy's explanation.
