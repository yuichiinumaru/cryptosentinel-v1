## Executive Summary
The paper proposes ARTEMIS, a communication-centric approach for designing the software architecture of multi-agent systems (MAS). It emphasizes the communication aspects of the MAS, which are often the most complex part. ARTEMIS is based on the following principles: agents are autonomous and have their own control over their behavior, agents communicate with each other through messages, the communication between agents is asynchronous, and the architecture of the MAS is defined by the communication patterns between the agents.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **Communication-Centric Design:** Emphasize the communication patterns between the agents in the system. This is already partially implemented with the `Debate` architecture, but can be improved.
- **Formalized Communication Protocols:** Define the communication protocols between the agents more formally. This will make the system more robust and easier to debug.
- **Dynamic Architectures:** The paper mentions dynamic architectures. We can explore how to dynamically change the communication patterns between the agents based on the market conditions.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Communication-Centric Design | Partially implemented in `backend/agents/researchers.py` with the `Debate` architecture. | A more formal and explicit definition of the communication patterns between all agents, not just the researchers. |
| Formalized Communication Protocols | No formal definition of the communication protocols. Communication is done ad-hoc. | A formal definition of the message formats and the interaction protocols between the agents. |
| Dynamic Architectures | The architecture is static. The agents and their communication patterns are defined at startup. | A mechanism to dynamically change the communication patterns between the agents based on the market conditions. |

## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*

- [ ] Task 1: Formally document the existing communication patterns between the agents.
- [ ] Task 2: Define a formal message format for the communication between the agents.
- [ ] Task 3: Implement a mechanism to dynamically change the communication patterns between the agents based on the market conditions. This could be a new `ArchitectureManager` agent.
