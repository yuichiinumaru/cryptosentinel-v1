## Executive Summary
This paper introduces JigsawComm, a framework designed to solve the communication bandwidth problem in multi-agent cooperative perception (CP), particularly for autonomous vehicles. The core contribution is a novel method that jointly optimizes semantic feature encoding (what to represent) and transmission scheduling (what to send) to maximize perception accuracy under severe bandwidth constraints. JigsawComm employs a lightweight "Feature Utility Estimator" (FUE) that allows each agent to predict the value of its own sensory data. Agents exchange these compact utility maps, and a deterministic, provably optimal policy is used to build a final, fused picture: for any given physical space, only the single agent with the highest utility data transmits its features. This "jigsaw puzzle" approach fundamentally eliminates inter-agent redundancy, achieving a scalable O(1) communication cost that is constant regardless of the number of agents. The framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing the required communication volume by over 500x compared to previous methods.

## Idea Brainstorming
*What concepts are potentially useful for THIS project?*
- **Scalable, Redundancy-Aware Communication (O(1) Cost):** The "Top-1" scheduling policy is a powerful concept for our multi-agent architecture. Instead of having all researcher agents (e.g., `BullResearcher`, `BearResearcher`) submit full reports to the `DebateCoordinator`, they could first submit a compact "utility score" for their analysis on various topics. The coordinator would then request the full analysis only from the agent providing the most value on each topic. This directly aligns with the architectural goal of "heuristic-based context filtering" by preventing prompt dilution and reducing internal data traffic.

- **Feature Utility Estimator (FUE):** The idea of a lightweight model that predicts the downstream value of a larger data payload is highly applicable to our Cognitive Fusion Architecture's Triage Layer (L2). We can design an "FUE" module for L2 that rapidly assesses incoming information (market data, news, etc.) and assigns a "relevance score." Only information surpassing a dynamic threshold would be passed to the more resource-intensive cognitive agents in L3. This elevates the triage process from simple heuristic filtering to an intelligent, learned gatekeeper.

- **End-to-End Learned Scheduling:** While we don't train our models in a traditional sense, the principle of making the data-filtering and data-routing policies responsive to final outcomes is critical. This implies creating a feedback loop where the performance of a final decision (e.g., a trade executed by the `DeepTraderManager`) is used to refine the rules within the Triage Layer's FUE and the `DebateCoordinator`'s scheduling policy. This moves the system from a static workflow to a self-optimizing one.

## Gap Analysis
*Compare paper concepts vs. `current_codebase`. What do we already have? What is missing?*

| Feature/Concept | Current State (Codebase) | Missing / Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scalable O(1) Communication** | Agents likely broadcast all findings to a manager/coordinator, an O(N) pattern that creates data overload and redundancy. | A two-phase communication protocol where agents first broadcast lightweight "utility scores" and the coordinator then requests full data from only the Top-1 agent per topic. |
| **Feature Utility Estimator (FUE)** | The Triage Layer (L2) exists conceptually for "heuristic-based context filtering," likely using static rules (e.g., keywords, source whitelists). | A dedicated, lightweight FUE module within L2 that learns to predict the utility of information for downstream agents. This requires a new trainable component and a data pipeline to support it. |
| **Dynamic Scheduling Feedback** | System architecture is likely feed-forward; data filtering and routing rules are static and do not adapt based on performance. | A feedback loop from the Action Layer (L4) back to the Perception (L2) and Cognition (L3) layers. This would enable the FUE and schedulers to dynamically adjust their parameters based on the measured quality of the final outcome. |

## Implementation Plan
*Granular, step-by-step task list to port the ideas to our code.*

- [ ] **Phase 1: Implement Utility-Aware Agent Communication**
    - [ ] Task 1.1: Augment the agent communication protocol to support a two-stage process: 1) broadcasting a `utility_map` (e.g., `{'topic': 'score'}`) and 2) responding to targeted requests for full data.
    - [ ] Task 1.2: Rearchitect the `DebateCoordinator` to function as a scheduler. It will aggregate incoming `utility_map`s and implement the "Top-1" policy to request detailed analysis from the most relevant agent for each topic.
    - [ ] Task 1.3: Develop a `UtilityScoringToolkit` for agents. Initially, this can use heuristics (e.g., confidence level, uniqueness of data sources), but should be designed as a pluggable component to be replaced by a learned model.

- [ ] **Phase 2: Develop and Integrate an FUE for the Triage Layer (L2)**
    - [ ] Task 2.1: Design and build a standalone FUE service. This service will expose an API endpoint that accepts unstructured/structured data and returns a normalized utility score.
    - [ ] Task 2.2: Integrate the FUE service into the Triage Layer's data ingestion pipeline, making it the primary mechanism for filtering out low-value information before it reaches cognitive agents.
    - [ ] Task 2.3: Implement comprehensive logging to capture the FUE's inputs, outputs, and the eventual outcome of the information, creating a dataset for future FUE model training and refinement.

- [ ] **Phase 3: Establish a Performance Feedback Loop**
    - [ ] Task 3.1: Create a `PerformanceMonitor` service responsible for evaluating the final outputs of the system (e.g., trade profitability, accuracy of forecasts).
    - [ ] Task 3.2: Develop an offline analysis pipeline that correlates the `PerformanceMonitor`'s findings with the `FUE` and `DebateCoordinator` logs. The goal is to identify patterns where the system's filtering/scheduling decisions led to suboptimal outcomes.
    - [ ] Task 3.3: Use the insights from the offline analysis to manually or automatically fine-tune the parameters and logic within the FUE and the agent utility models.
